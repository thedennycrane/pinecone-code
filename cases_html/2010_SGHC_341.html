<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The substantive issue in Originating Summons 17
                    of 2008 (“OS 17/2008”) was the plaintiffs’ appeal to have a
                    decision of the Strata Titles Board (“the Board”) set aside and to
                    have their original application for approval of the collective sale of the
                    condominium development known as Regent Court (Strata Title Plan No 866
                    comprised in Land Lot Mukim 17-5574T) remitted to the Board for a fresh
                    decision. On 30 October 2008, I heard the appeal and granted the orders
                    sought. I ordered the Board to decide who should bear the costs of the earlier
                    hearing before it after it had completed the proceedings. I then adjourned the
                    question of the costs of the appeal to a later date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Pursuant to my order of 30 October 2008,
                    the Board recommenced hearing the plaintiffs’ application for approval of
                    the proposed collective sale on 18 March 2009. By that time, however, new
                    information had come to light: the agreement relating to the collective sale
                    (“the SPA”) had not, in fact, been stamped. The Board learnt of
                    this from a letter sent (without prior request or prompting) by the Inland
                    Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) dated 4 December
                    2008; they then brought the letter’s contents to the parties’
                    attention. The parties made an attempt to settle the matter but were
                    unsuccessful. On 23 March 2009, the Board gave the parties one final
                    opportunity to have the SPA stamped; alternatively, they were to make one final
                    attempt at arriving at a settlement. On 24 March, though, the SPA remained
                    unstamped and no settlement had been arrived at. The Board then dismissed the
                    plaintiffs’ application for approval of the collective sale on the ground
                    that neither side would have been able to discharge their burden of proof
                    without making reference to the SPA which, being unstamped, could not be
                    admitted as evidence before the Board. It also directed parties to bear their
                    own costs. On 27 July 2009, the seventh and eighth defendants filed Summons
                    No 3938 of 2009 (“Sum 3938/2009”) to have my decision of
                    30 October 2008 set aside on the basis of the non-stamping of the SPA.
                    Woo J heard the matter and dismissed the application on 18 August
                    2010. The seventh and eight defendants were ordered to pay the plaintiffs their
                    costs in defending Sum 3938/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 22 July 2010, parties returned before me
                    to address the question of costs awardable on the outcome of OS 17/2008. It was
                    no surprise, in light of the previous cost orders made by the STB and by
                    Woo J in Sum 3938/2009, that the arguments before me were hard-fought and
                    fraught – doubtlessly, the defendants felt hard done by when they were
                    required to bear their own and the plaintiffs’ costs in the STB
                    proceedings and Sum 3938/2009 respectively. Nevertheless – as the
                    plaintiffs were quick to remind me – the default position in law is that
                    costs follow the event: see O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, Rule 5, 2006 Rev Ed). For all that happened after
                    30 October 2008, the fact remained that the plaintiffs had succeeded on
                    their substantive application before me in OS 17/2008; they were entitled,
                    therefore, to their costs unless it could be shown that the circumstances of the
                    case justified an order otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties’ Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Costs are awarded at the court’s
                    discretion; nevertheless, as I have already mentioned, the general rule is that
                    cost should follow the event unless it appears to the court that in the
                    circumstances of the case some other order should be made or that there are
                    special reasons for depriving the successful litigant of his costs in part or in
                    full: O 59 r 3(2); <em>Tullio Planata v Maoro Andrea
                        G</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 501 (“<em>Tullio</em>”); and <em>Ho Kon Kim v Lim Gek Kim
                        Betsy and others and another appeal</em> [2001]
                    3 SLR(R) 253. These reasons may arise from the conduct of all the
                    parties, both from before and during the proceedings: O 59 r 5(1)(b).
                    They would include the conduct of any party in raising unnecessary claims or
                    issues and in unreasonably or improperly acting or omitting to act in such a way
                    as to save costs: O 59 r 6A(1) and r 7,
                respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It was submitted by Mr Low on behalf of the
                    plaintiffs that the only special reason that might justify depriving a
                    successful party of its costs would be if that party had acted either improperly
                    or unreasonably: <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>
                    (GP Selvam ed-in-chief) (Singapore Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007), at
                    para 59/3/7. In this case, the plaintiffs did neither. They alleged that it
                    was the defendants – in particular the eight defendant – who made
                    factual allegations that sought to discredit the plaintiffs and their
                    solicitors, failed to address the relevant point of law before the court, and
                    who made procedural errors that unnecessarily complicated the plaintiffs’
                    response and preparation for the appeal in OS 17/2008. Thus, any wasted time and
                    costs arose out of the defendants’ conduct and the plaintiffs could not be
                    said to be disentitled to their costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       However, Mr Singh (for the first to sixth
                    defendants) submitted that it was more appropriate in this case for no order to
                    be made as to costs. He relied on three main grounds for this submission: first,
                    he pointed out that the plaintiffs were being maintained in this action by a
                    non-party (the purchaser’s property agent who was responsible for
                    arranging the collective sale). To award the plaintiffs costs would amount,
                    therefore, to awarding them a bonus. His second point was that the issue raised
                    in OS 17/2008 dealt with a legal question that was both novel and of general
                    interest and, as a result, the defendants should not be made to bear the
                    plaintiffs’ costs in the appeal. Finally, he argued that the defendants
                    had already been deprived of costs by the STB on two previous occasions. The
                    court should, he argued, take note of this fact in deciding the appropriate
                    costs order in OS 17/2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mr Rai, who was the eight defendant and who
                    argued on behalf of himself and the seventh defendant, submitted that the
                    plaintiffs should not merely be deprived of their costs but have costs ordered
                    against them as well. I shall be considering Mr Rai’s arguments in
                    greater detail below. For now, it suffices to summarise his arguments thus: that
                    it was the plaintiffs’ failure to ensure that the SPA had been duly
                    stamped and failure to disclose this fact earlier that caused parties to waste
                    much time and effort in addressing a futile case. For that reason, they should
                    be deprived of their costs and ordered to pay costs to the defendants
                    instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mr Cheong, for the ninth and tenth
                    defendants, also asked that no order be made as to costs. He supplemented
                    Mr Rai’s submissions with reference to ss 42 and 63 of the Stamp
                    Duties Act (Cap 312, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) –
                    arguing that the failure to procure the stamping of the SPA amounted to an
                    offence under the Act and this was conduct that the court could and would take
                    into consideration in assessing costs. As for the question of maintenance: while
                    Mr Cheong acknowledged that plaintiffs were not being maintained by a third
                    party in the technical sense of the word, he argued that where a successful
                    plaintiff had agreed with his solicitor not to pay the latter any costs for
                    conducting the action on his behalf, that plaintiff would be precluded from
                    recovering costs from the other side. Again, the details of this argument will
                    be considered below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I do not accept Mr Singh’s
                    submissions concerning the (supposed) novelty of the point of law raised in OS
                    17/2008 relevant to the question of costs before me; nor do I accept his
                    submission concerning the defendants’ (alleged) deprivation of costs in
                    the hearing before the STB. Both arguments seem to me to have no impact on the
                    question of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to costs following their success
                    in OS 17/2008. The complaint about deprivation of costs, in particular, is one
                    that should be taken up before the STB itself. This is not the forum for it and
                    it evidently has no bearing on the costs of OS 17/2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There are, however, two issues raised that
                    – to my mind – may have an impact on the plaintiffs’
                    entitlement to costs. These are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The non-stamping of the SPA;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The nature
                        of the fee-paying arrangement between the plaintiffs and their
                        solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I shall address them in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The failure to procure stamping of the SPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As mentioned, it was Mr Rai who first
                    raised the fact of the SPA’s non-stamping as a relevant consideration to
                    the plaintiffs’ entitlement to costs. In <em>Tullio</em>, the Singapore Court of Appeal, at [24], endorsed the
                    headnote from the English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Re
                        Elgindata Ltd (No 2)</em> [1992] 1 WLR 1207 as accurately
                    summarising the relevant principles governing the award of costs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The principles on which costs were to be awarded were (i) that costs
                        were in the discretion of the court, (ii) that costs should follow the event
                        except when it appeared to the court that in the circumstances of the case
                        some other order should be made, (iii) that the general rule did not cease
                        to apply simply because the successful party raised issues or made
                        allegations that failed, but that <em>he could be deprived of
                            his costs in whole or in part where he had caused a significant increase
                            in the length of the proceedings</em>, and (iv) that <em>where the successful party raised issues or made allegations
                            improperly or unreasonably the court could not only deprive him of his
                            costs but could also order him to pay the whole or part of the
                            unsuccessful party’s costs</em>. The fourth principle
                        implied, moreover, that a successful party who neither improperly nor
                        unreasonably raised issues or made allegations which failed ought not to be
                        ordered to pay any part of the unsuccessful party’s costs...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to Mr Rai, the plaintiffs’ failure to ensure that
                    the SPA had been duly stamped and their failure to disclose this fact earlier
                    caused a significant increase in the length of the proceedings. He argued that
                    the plaintiffs’ arguments in OS 17/2008 had been made improperly and
                    unreasonably as they were, in the end, entirely futile. As the SPA had not been
                    stamped, it could not be used before the STB as evidence and without it being in
                    evidence, the plaintiffs could not proceed with their application for collective
                    sale. Thus, he submitted, principles (iii) and (iv) from <em>Tullio</em> justified depriving the plaintiffs of their costs and
                    ordering that costs should be paid to the defendants instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mr Cheong’s argument on the
                    relevancy of the non-stamping of the SPA to the question of costs was couched in
                    more subtle terms. Section 42 of the Act states that “all instruments
                    chargeable with duty and executed by any person in Singapore <em>shall</em> be stamped before being executed [emphasis added].”
                    The use of “shall” implies a positive duty to ensure that a
                    document (such as the SPA) is properly stamped, while s 63 goes further to
                    provide that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any person who –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    having drawn, made, executed or signed, otherwise
                            than as a witness, any instrument that is chargeable with duty without
                            the instrument being duly stamped and fails, without lawful excuse to
                                <em>procure the due stamping of the
                                instrument</em> within the time within which the instrument
                            may be stamped without penalty under this Act...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine
                        not exceeding $1,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiffs’ failure to procure the stamping of the SPA
                    amounted, therefore, to an offence under the Act and, according to
                    Mr Cheong, a court could not and should not ignore that fact. Where a
                    party’s failure to fulfil a statutory duty would have disposed of an
                    appeal one way or the other, a court should take such conduct into consideration
                    by denying them costs. The entire purpose of introducing the SPA as evidence
                    before the STB (and indeed, its entire purpose when it was referred to in OS
                    17/2008) was to demonstrate the purchaser’s intention to proceed with the
                    sale; thus, the fact that it was not stamped was evidence to the contrary. Had
                    the intention not to proceed with completion been known at either the STB
                    hearing or the hearing of OS 17/2008, the plaintiff’s application in the
                    former would have been dismissed out of hand and the latter would never have
                    been pursued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Mr Low’s responses to the arguments
                    above canvassed several points previously made before Woo J at the hearing
                    for Sum 3938/2009. First, he argued that there was no duty or obligation on the
                    plaintiff to ensure that the SPA had been stamped. Section 34(a) of the Act
                    – in conjunction with the Third Schedule – made it clear that the
                    stamp duty in conveyances such as this was to be borne by the transferee or
                    purchaser. The plaintiffs were under no duty to ensure that the purchaser
                    complied with the purchaser’s own obligations under the statute; nor could
                    they be faulted for having failed to check with the purchaser in order to
                    establish whether the SPA had been stamped. Secondly, he reiterated that there
                    was no basis to suggest that the plaintiffs concealed or were even aware of the
                    fact that the SPA was unstamped. His third point was that the failure to
                    disclose the non-stamping of the SPA earlier might not necessarily have obviated
                    the need for the STB hearings or the hearing in OS 17/2008. Section 52(2)
                    of the Act expressly allows unstamped documents to be admitted in evidence upon
                    payment of the relevant duty and penalty under s 46 of the Act and this was
                    precisely what the STB allowed the parties to do when the failure to stamp the
                    SPA first became known. The Board only dismissed the application in March 2009
                    when it became manifestly clear that the purchaser would not be rectifying the
                    omission and having the documents stamped. The fact that the purchaser proved
                    unwilling to stamp the SPA in 2009 did not necessarily mean that it would have
                    been unwilling – if offered the opportunity – to stamp the SPA at an
                    earlier point of time. It could not, therefore, be said that the hearings that
                    proceeded on the basis of the SPA would have been obviated had the fact that the
                    SPA was not stamped been known at an earlier stage. At the hearing of Sum
                    3938/2009, Woo J accepted these arguments in rebuttal to the seventh and
                    eighth defendants’ application to strike out my initial order in
                    OS 17/2008. Mr Low, no doubt, hoped that they might have the same
                    effect here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Having considered the arguments, I am not
                    inclined to agree with Mr Rai’s submissions on this issue. He argued
                    that the plaintiffs acted improperly in failing to disclose that the SPA was
                    unstamped and placed great reliance on the English Court of Appeal’s
                    decision in <em>Goodwood Recoveries Ltd v Breen; Breen v
                        Slater</em> [2006] 1 WLR 2723, where the third party’s
                    conduct included (amongst other things) suppressing the disclosure of a key
                    document. That conduct was held sufficient to justify ordering the third party
                    to pay all the costs of the action on an indemnity basis. However, I find this
                    case to be of limited assistance to Mr Rai. In <em>Goodwood</em>, Rix LJ made it clear that it was the third
                    party’s <em>dishonest suppression</em> of a key
                    document that justified the adverse order of costs. In sharp contrast, the
                    plaintiffs have categorically denied any knowledge of the purchaser’s
                    failure to stamp the SPA prior to 22 December 2008. They affirmed this in
                    an affidavit filed by Mr Amin on 13 August 2009 and again through
                    their solicitors at the hearing before me. As of 22 December 2008, the
                    substantive appeal in OS 17/2008 had been both heard and disposed of.
                    Mr Rai had, at the hearing of Sum 3938/2009 before Woo J, disputed the
                    plaintiffs’ claim to ignorance, but at the hearing before me he appeared
                    to accept that the worst that could be said is that the plaintiffs had been
                    merely indifferent. It could hardly be argued, therefore, that the whole of the
                    costs of the litigation in OS 17/2008 were caused by the plaintiffs’
                    dishonesty, impropriety and exceptional conduct. The conduct of the plaintiffs
                    in the present case was in no way on par with that of the third party in
                        <em>Goodwood</em>. The plaintiffs cannot, therefore, be
                    deprived of their costs in OS 17/2008 on the basis that they failed to disclose
                    the failure to stamp the SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I turn now to Mr Cheong’s
                    submissions. As mentioned above, costs are awarded in exercise of the
                    Court’s discretion: O 59 r 3(2). O 59 r 5 provides
                    that in exercising that discretion, the Court shall “as may be
                    appropriate in the circumstances, take into account... the conduct of all the
                    parties, including conduct before, as well as during, the proceedings...”
                    The Rules of Court identify particular kinds of conduct where a court should be
                    more willing to deem costs unnecessarily incurred: see O 59 rr 6A and 7.
                    However, as O 59 r 6A explicitly recognises, these are “[i]n
                    addition to and not in derogation [from]” the basic principle stated in
                    O 59 r 5 – namely, that in exercising his or her discretion as
                    to the costs of any proceedings, a judge is entitled to consider any relevant
                    aspect of the parties’ conduct whether such conduct occurred before or
                    during the legal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, was the non-stamping of the SPA an
                    aspect of the plaintiffs’ conduct at all? The immediate answer would
                    appear to be “No”. The failure to stamp the SPA was a failure on
                    the part of the purchaser and not the plaintiffs; concomitantly, any offence
                    committed would have been committed by the purchaser and not the plaintiffs
                    themselves. As Mr Low pointed out, s 34 of the Act (read with the
                    Third Schedule) places the obligation to pay stamp duty on the transferee or
                    purchaser in a conveyance; s 49 similarly provides that it is the person
                    liable under the Third Schedule to pay stamp duty who is liable for any penalty
                    arising from a failure to have the conveyance stamped on time. Section 63(a), on
                    which Mr Cheong so heavily relies, then makes it an offence for any person
                    who has drawn, made, executed or signed an instrument that is chargeable with
                    duty to “[fail], without lawful excuse, to procure the due stamping of
                    the said instrument within the [specified] time”. However, the act of
                    paying stamp duty is inseparable from the act of <em>having</em> an instrument stamped and this is especially true under
                    the E-Stamping regimes established by ss 6B - 6D of the Act. While the language
                    of procurement may at first sight seem broad, therefore, I find that in light of
                    the cited provisions the duty to procure the due stamping of a conveyance in
                    s 63(a) must be read as falling squarely on the person liable to pay the
                    stamp duty under the Act. In this case, that would have been the purchaser
                    – not the plaintiffs. There was therefore no illegal conduct on the part
                    of the plaintiffs’ part that I (in the words of Mr Cheong)
                    “cannot ignore” whilst exercising my discretion in order to
                    determine the costs payable in OS 17/2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Having said as much, it is true that the
                    plaintiffs were guilty of omitting to check if the purchasers had stamped the
                    SPA before bringing their original application before the STB. It is also true
                    that – as events turned out – if the SPA had been properly stamped
                    or the fact of its non-stamping been discovered much earlier, costs could have
                    been saved. And while Mr Low argued that the defendants could have taken
                    the initiative to write to the IRAS or to the purchasers, the truth of the
                    matter is that the plaintiffs were the parties best-placed to check on the
                    status of the SPA and whether it had been stamped or not as they would have been
                    in regular contact with the purchasers over the potential sale of the
                    condominium. In my view this omission to check on the status of a document that
                    they were signatories to and that they would, inevitably, have to rely on before
                    the STB in order to make their application would and should constitute relevant
                    conduct for the purposes of determining the appropriate order as to costs in OS
                    17/2008. However, it is only one factor to be considered; it should not be given
                    more weight than it deserves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The non-stamping of the SPA was – as
                    Woo J correctly observed at [15] of his judgment, in Sum 3938/2009 (found
                    at [2009] SGHC 216) – a situation that could have been easily
                    rectified at any time. It did not affect the essential validity of the document
                    but merely rendered it inadmissible in evidence. Section 52(2) of the Act
                    explicitly provides for admissibility upon payment of the stamp duty and any
                    penalty. Thus, as Mr Low suggested, it is by no means evident that early
                    discovery of the non-stamping of the SPA would have obviated the need for the
                    STB proceedings and OS 17/2008. Had the non-stamping of the SPA been discovered
                    in 2007 and the situation rectified, the STB application may have continued as a
                    matter of course with nothing more than a slight delay. Mr Rai and
                    Mr Cheong were wrong, therefore, to ascribe the causative significance that
                    they did to the non-stamping of the SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Even if Mr Rai and Mr Cheong were
                    right – and proceedings before the STB and in OS 17/2008 could have been
                    avoided entirely had the SPA’s non-stamping been discovered earlier
                    – it is not clear whether this fact suffices on its own to deprive the
                    plaintiffs of all their costs in OS 17/2008. There is also the defendants’
                    own conduct to consider: in particular, the conduct of the seventh and eight
                    defendants in filing Summons No 396 of 2008 and Sum No 3938/2008 to strike out
                    the plaintiffs’ application in OS 17/2008 and set aside the outcome of the
                    same. A glance at the history of OS 17/2008 would show that both these summonses
                    were responsible in no small way for prolonging and complicating the
                    proceedings. Summons No 396 of 2008 was fixed to be heard together with the
                    substantive application in OS 17/2008 on 9 October 2008 for a full day. As
                    a result of the extensive arguments canvassed in the Summons, though, I had to
                    adjourn OS 17/2008 to be heard on 30 October 2008. That took another full
                    day and left no time for the question of costs to be considered. Consequently,
                    the latter was fixed to be heard on 10 July 2009. On 10 July 2009,
                    however, it became clear that a further adjournment was necessary as the seventh
                    defendants indicated that they intended to commence proceedings to set aside my
                    original decision in OS 17/2008. The resulting Sum No 3938/2008 was originally
                    fixed before me. I declined to hear it and it had to be adjourned once more
                    before it was finally heard by Woo J on 11 and 18 August 2009. When
                    the parties finally returned to argue the issue of costs before me on
                    22 July 2010, therefore, more than 2 years had passed since OS 17/2008
                    was filed on 7 January 2008. The sequence of events shows that some
                    responsibility for this delay must lie at the defendants’
                doors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In conclusion, therefore, it was not the
                    plaintiffs own conduct that led to the non-stamping of the SPA; nor was there
                    any evidence that they knew, but dishonestly failed to disclose, the fact of the
                    SPA’s non-stamping to the STB and the defendants. They may not be deprived
                    of their costs in OS 17/2008 on these grounds. While the failure to check on the
                    status of the SPA might constitute conduct relevant to my assessment of the
                    amount of costs payable in OS 17/2008, it is conduct that must be weighed
                    on its own merits and alongside the defendants’ own actions. In my view,
                    the failure to check with the purchaser on the stamping of the SPA could justify
                    a slight reduction in the costs awarded to the plaintiffs in OS 17/2008. It
                    cannot, however, justify depriving them of their costs entirely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiffs’ fee-paying arrangement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The second issue concerned the nature of the
                    fee-paying arrangement between the plaintiffs and their solicitors.
                    Mr Singh argued that since the plaintiffs’ appeal in OS 17/2008 was
                    being maintained by a non-party to the litigation, the plaintiffs may rightly be
                    deprived of the entirety of their costs. He pointed to the following three
                    paragraphs from the second affidavit of Mr Mohamed Amin bin Mohamed Taib
                    filed on 22 February 2008 in order to support his allegation of
                    maintenance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">139    For completeness, the Sale Commitee has already
                            explained in paragraph 5 of Ms Mok’s Affidavit that <em>the legal fees for this Appeal and OS 103 are being paid by
                                Mr Chew Lay Seong</em>... of Eccoventure Pte Ltd, who is
                            the property agent of the Purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">140    The Sale Committee was in a difficult position as
                            a result of the purported dissolution of the Sale Committee at the EOGM,
                            and the Majority Owners’ obligation to prosecute this Appeal
                            within the time period allowed in law. The Sale Committee had to
                            urgently clarify its standing through OS 103 and to file the Appeal.
                            However, we did not have the funds to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">141    As Mr Chew offered to pay for the legal fees
                            incurred in the Appeal and OS 103, and we were advised that there is no
                            conflict of interest, we therefore accepted Mr Chew’s
                            offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to Mr Singh, the fact that the legal fees were being
                    paid for by Mr Chew indicated that the plaintiffs did not and would not
                    themselves incur any legal fees in OS 17/2008. The rule at common law is that a
                    litigant may not recover from the opposing litigant more than what he is liable
                    to pay to his own solicitor in costs; in short, party and party costs are given
                    in the character of an indemnity: <em>Gundry v
                        Sainsbury</em> [1910] 1 KB 645, 649. Since the plaintiffs
                    admitted that the fees for OS 17/2008 were being borne by a non-party, what they
                    have indicated is that they would not be incurring any legal costs themselves.
                    As a result, any costs paid to them by the defendants would not amount to
                    compensation but a bonus instead. The plaintiffs should, therefore, be deprived
                    of their costs in OS 17/2008 in their entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Cheong expanded on the arguments of
                    Mr Singh: he pointed out that the mere fact that Mr Chew offered to
                    pay the plaintiffs’ solicitors their legal fees would not necessarily
                    amount to maintenance disentitling the plaintiffs to costs if the primary
                    obligation to pay their solicitors lay with the plaintiffs. The losing party in
                    litigation is obliged to pay such costs as the receiving party is primarily and
                    potentially legally obliged to pay to his solicitor: <em>Joyce v
                        Kammac (1988) Ltd</em> [1996] 1 All ER 923, 928. In
                    most cases, that obligation would be set out in the written retainer. But where
                    the retainer reflected an understanding between solicitor and client that the
                    former would not look to the latter for their costs or fees (or where there was
                    a verbal agreement to the same effect) the rule is that no party-and-party costs
                    may be recovered: see <em>Joyce v Kammac</em>, 928;
                    Cozens-Hardy MR in <em>Gundry v Sainsbury</em>, 649.
                    The paragraphs in Mr Amin’s affidavit referred to by Mr Singh
                    indicated that a non-party had undertaken to bear the legal costs of maintaining
                    the action in OS 17/2008. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the
                    existence of an agreement to look to Mr Chew for legal fees could be
                    reasonably inferred. Mr Cheong accepted that the defendants will normally
                    bear the burden of proving that such an agreement exists. However, he also
                    submitted that the plaintiffs’ solicitors were – as officers of the
                    court – obliged to disclose the true nature of the agreement between the
                    plaintiffs and themselves. In the absence of such voluntary disclosure,
                    Mr Amin’s affidavit (and the arrangement that it hints at) must be
                    taken at face value and the plaintiffs must, as a result, be deprived of their
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mr Low made no substantive reply to
                    either Mr Singh or Mr Cheong’s submissions in his
                    rebuttal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Both Mr Singh and Mr Cheong rightly
                    pointed out that party and party costs are given in the character of an
                    indemnity. In other words, they are awarded to indemnify the successful party
                    for the costs and expenses he has incurred in the litigation: Michael J
                    Cook, <em>Cook on Costs 2010</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) at
                    para 17.1. The indemnity is not complete, but it is an indemnity in this
                    sense: namely, that costs between the parties can never exceed the solicitor and
                    client costs. The receiving party cannot make a profit out of the costs
                    recovered from the other party: <em>Cook on Costs</em> at
                    para 17.2. The principle finds its earliest expression in <em>Harold v Smith</em> (1860)
                    5 H &amp; N 381, where it was stated by Bramwell B., at 385,
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Costs as between party and party are given by the law as an indemnity to
                        the person entitled to them; they are not imposed as a punishment on the
                        party who pays them, nor given as a bonus to the party who receives them.
                            <em>Therefore, if the extent of the damnification can be
                            found out, the extent to which costs ought to be allowed is also
                            ascertained</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is also the position adopted by local statutory law.
                    Section 112(2) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    provides that a litigant should not be entitled to recover from any other person
                    more in costs than the amount payable by the litigant to his own solicitor under
                    a s 111(1) written agreement between himself and his solicitor governing
                    the amount and manner of the payment of costs for conducting contentious
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This principle of indemnity is the foundation
                    for a second rule: that, if a solicitor expressly or impliedly agrees that he
                    will not in any circumstances charge his client, no costs are recoverable from
                    the other party (<em>Cook on Costs</em> at para 17.3;
                        <em>Gundry v Sainsbury</em>, <em>supra</em>; and <em>British Waterways Board v
                        Norman</em> (1993) 26 HLR 232). Thus, where a solicitor has
                    expressly agreed that his client is primarily and legally obliged to pay him his
                    legal fees but accepts payment from another in lieu of such payment, costs may
                    still be recovered. An early form of this position was set out in <em>Davies (A.P.) (suing as widow and administratrix of the estate of
                        Kenneth Stanley Davies, decd) v Taylor (No 2)</em>
                    [1974] AC 225 by Lord Cross of Chelsea, at 234. In the context of a
                    claim for payment out from the Legal Aid Fund to a victorious litigant, it was
                    observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No doubt if it were shown that the respondent’s solicitor had agreed
                        with him that in no circumstances would he hold him liable to pay any part
                        of them then the costs, though incurred by the solicitor in defending the
                        case, would not be costs “incurred” by the respondent, but it
                        was not suggested that any such agreement... was made in this case. If there
                        was no such agreement then the fact that the insurance company had
                        undertaken to indemnify the respondent against his liability for these costs
                        would not mean that they were not costs “incurred” by
                        him...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The same principle is expressed a little more strongly in the decision
                    of <em>Joyce v Kammac</em>, <em>supra</em>, which was relied upon by Mr Cheong in the course of
                    his argument. There, Morland J stated, at 928:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general principle [at common law] is that the party in whose favour
                        the order for costs was made... is entitled to be indemnified in respect of
                        such costs that he was primarily and potentially legally obliged to pay to
                        his solicitors. It matters not whether the receiving party was able or not
                        to discharge that legal obligation, so long as the primary potential legal
                        obligation to his solicitors existed. <em>It matters not
                            whether the receiving party was able to discharge that legal obligation
                            from funds of his own or funds provided by friends, family, trade union,
                            employer, insurer or otherwise, so long as the obligation was primarily
                            his</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the fact that the purchaser’s property agent would
                    ultimately be bearing the legal fees of OS 17/2008 is immaterial to determining
                    the plaintiffs’ entitlement to costs <em>unless</em>
                    it could be shown that the plaintiffs were not primarily and potentially legally
                    obliged to pay their solicitors at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The critical question in the present case is
                    therefore clear: was there an agreement between the plaintiffs and their
                    solicitors that the latter would not look to them for their legal costs? The
                    question is not one of law but of fact. It also raises a second issue: namely,
                    how should a court approach disputes of fact that arise in the context of a
                    hearing on the issue of costs? In answering these questions, I should highlight
                    at the outset two points derived from the authorities cited above. The first is
                    Bramwell B.’s dictum in <em>Harold v Smith</em>
                    that, “[I]f the extent of the damnification can be found out, the extent
                    to which costs ought to be allowed is also ascertained.” The second is
                    the fact observed by Morland J in <em>Joyce v
                        Kammac</em>: namely, that in most cases the obligation of a client to
                    pay his solicitors’ costs may be found in the latter’s written
                    retainer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Mr Cheong pointed out that it was
                    Mr Amin who gave evidence that the legal fees of OS 17/2008 were to be
                    borne not by the plaintiffs but by another. It was the plaintiffs’ own
                    evidence that raised the very real possibility that an agreement by the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors not to charge their clients was actually made; the
                    onus was on them, therefore, to adduce some evidence in order to support any
                    assertion to the contrary. Mr Cheong submitted that the best way for the
                    plaintiffs to do this was to disclose the terms of their solicitors’
                    retainer to the court. On his part, he would be satisfied with the court having
                    sight of the document; he and his clients would not insist seeing it for
                    themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The first portion of Mr Cheong’s
                    argument above is consistent with the position espoused by Hobhouse J in
                        <em>Pamplin v Express Newspapers Ltd</em> [1985]
                    1 WLR 689, 696-697:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the taxation a problem may arise. An issue of fact may emerge which
                        necessitates the master making formally or informally a finding of fact. In
                        such a situation, the master may have to ask the claimant what evidence he
                        wishes to rely upon in support of the contested allegation of fact...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The master does not have any power to order discovery to be given; he does
                        not have any power to override a right of privilege. But it is the duty of
                        the master, if the respondent raises a factual issue, which is real and
                        relevant and not a sham or fanciful dispute, to require the claimant to
                        prove the facts upon which he relies. The claimant then has to choose what
                        evidence he will adduce and to what extent he will waive his privilege. That
                        is a choice for the claimant alone. The master then has to decide the issue
                        of fact on the evidence [and consider] whether he is satisfied by the
                        evidence...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This seems to me to be the correct approach to take. The evidence that
                    is currently before me strongly suggests the existence of an agreement stating
                    that the plaintiffs’ solicitors will not be looking to the plaintiffs for
                    their legal fees; it is only fair that the plaintiffs should be given a chance
                    to voluntarily respond and adduce such evidence to rebut the allegation made
                    against them. As this was not a taxation hearing, I could not compel the
                    plaintiffs to produce their written retainer. Operating on the basis of the
                        <em>Pamplin</em> approach, however, I could and did
                    invite the plaintiffs to (voluntarily) waive privilege and disclose the written
                    retainer in order to determine the true nature of the arrangement they have with
                    their solicitors. After taking instructions from their clients, the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors indicated that their clients were not willing to
                    waive their privilege, nor make the limited disclosure being asked of them.
                    Pressed for a response to Mr Singh and Mr Cheong’s allegations,
                    all Mr Low could offer was his assurance that the plaintiffs were their
                    clients on record and that the written retainer reflected the agreement arrived
                    at between Mr Chew and the plaintiffs for Mr Chew to pay the legal
                    costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiffs’ unwillingness to waive
                    privilege and disclose the terms of their retainer meant that I had to consider
                    the impact of their silence on the finding of fact that I had to make concerning
                    the existence of an agreement between the plaintiffs and their solicitors and on
                    my final assessment of the plaintiffs’ entitlement to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiffs could not – by virtue of
                    s 131 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) – be
                    compelled to disclose their solicitors’ retainer to the court. However,
                    the dispute of fact is concerned with the nature of the plaintiffs’
                    agreement with their solicitors and this would evidently be a fact that was
                    especially within the plaintiffs’ knowledge. Section 108 of the Evidence
                    Act places the burden of proving such a fact squarely on the plaintiffs’
                    shoulders. The key provision in the Evidence Act, however, is s 116. It
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to
                        have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events,
                        human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the
                        facts of the particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Illustrations (g) and (h) to s 116 then go on to provide
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may presume –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    that evidence which could be and is not produced
                            would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;
                            [and]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    that if a man refuses to answer a question which
                            he is not compelled to answer by law, the answer if given would be
                            unfavourable to him...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 116, therefore, allows me to draw an adverse conclusion
                    from the plaintiffs’ silence and in my view, there is sufficient ground in
                    this case for me to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Pamplin</em>,
                    Hobhouse J stated, at 697, that where a claiming party has decided not to
                    waive privilege and to rely on other evidence in order to respond to a factual
                    issue raised in cost proceedings, the assessing master will “no doubt
                    take into account that the claimant may have a legitimate interest in not
                    adducing the most obvious or complete evidence, and may prefer to rely on oral
                    evidence rather than producing legal documents.” No such explanation was
                    given here, however, for the plaintiffs’ reluctance to disclose their
                    written retainer. The defendants did not ask to have sight of the retainer
                    themselves. They maintained they would be satisfied as long as the court did.
                    The facts of this case did not, therefore, raise the difficult issues of
                    limiting disclosure and restricting an opposing party’s access to
                    privileged documents that cases such as <em>Pamplin</em>
                    were concerned with. There was no such legitimate interest on the
                    plaintiffs’ part in withholding disclosure of their retainer. In addition,
                    the plaintiffs offered no alternative evidence to support their claim that the
                    terms of the written retainer “reflected” the arrangement with
                    Mr Chew and did not go so far as to waive the plaintiffs’ primary
                    obligation to pay their solicitors. Indeed, Mr Low’s careful and very
                    deliberate choice of words in describing the terms of the retainer (see
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) only served to heighten my
                    unease concerning the plaintiffs’ choice to withhold
                disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the circumstances, therefore, I find that
                    there is sufficient ground upon which to invoke the court’s power to draw
                    an adverse inference against the plaintiffs under s 116 of the Evidence
                    Act. Having thus found that there was an agreement between the plaintiffs and
                    their solicitors for the latter to look to a non-party for their legal costs, I
                    conclude that the plaintiffs are not primarily and potentially legally obliged
                    to pay their solicitors at all and, as a result, are not entitled to their costs
