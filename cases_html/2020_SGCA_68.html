On appeal to this court, the appellant sought to abandon its case at trial and instead decided to rely on a single new allegation of negligence which was not raised at all during the trial. For this purpose, the appellant applied by way of CA/SUM 23/2020 (“SUM 23”) to seek leave from the Court of Appeal under O 57 r 9A(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) to raise this new point on appeal and to amend its Statement of Claim (“SOC”) to plead the new allegation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In our judgment, it was too late and totally unjust for the appellant to change its case in so fundamental a manner on appeal.

</div> According to Dr Chen, in 2006, one Lee Fichow Helen (“Helen Lee”) offered to appoint him the sole distributor of products (“Immunotec Products”) manufactured by a Canadian company, Immunotec Incorporated (“Immunotec Inc”) (see [3] of the judgment of the High Court (“GD”) at [2019] SGHC 266). Helen Lee allegedly told Dr Chen that she was a director of Immunotec Research (S) Pte Ltd (“IRS”) and that she was the sole distributor of Immunotec Products in Singapore. On 24 March 2006, the appellant was incorporated by Dr Chen and two other doctors.

</div> On the same day, the appellant signed an agreement with IRS pursuant to which the appellant was appointed as the sole distributor of Immunotec Products in Singapore (“the IRS Distributorship Agreement”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Sometime in July or August 2006, the appellant believed that there was another distributor of Immunotec Products in Singapore. However, it was assured by Helen Lee that it was the sole distributor here. Around this time, Helen Lee also informed Dr Chen that IRS had changed its name to United Yield International Pte Ltd (“UYI”) and that the distributorship agreement had to be changed accordingly.

</div>
</div>
</div> Accordingly, a new agreement was signed between the appellant and UYI on 18 August 2006 (“the UYI Distributorship Agreement”) (GD at [4]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Dr Chen alleged that he subsequently discovered that IRS and UYI were in fact two separate companies and that there were other parallel importers in Singapore distributing Immunotec Products (GD at [5]). Further, the appellant was not recognised by Immunotec Inc as its sole distributor in Singapore because Helen Lee had not sought approval for this arrangement. However, after Dr Chen raised these matters to Helen Lee, UYI sent the appellant a notice on 18 October 2006 purporting to terminate the UYI Distributorship Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 8 October 2012 (ten days short of six years from the date of UYI’s notice of termination), Dr Chen met Mr Edmond Pereira (the second respondent) and informed him that he wanted his law firm, Edmond Pereira Law Corporation (the first respondent), to commence legal proceedings against Helen Lee and UYI (GD at [6]). On 13 October 2012, Dr Chen wrote to the respondents giving his views on the dispute. On 15 October 2012, Dr Chen wrote again to the respondents instructing them to commence action against Helen Lee and UYI as soon as possible. The same day, the respondents advised him that proceedings against UYI would not be easy as it had been struck off the register of companies. The respondents also advised that the claim against Helen Lee was unlikely to succeed as the agreement was between the appellant and UYI. On 16 October 2012, Dr Chen replied maintaining that Helen Lee had acted in her personal capacity. The same day, the respondents advised that both IRS and UYI had been struck off the register of companies, that Helen Lee had signed the distributorship agreements in her capacity as a director of IRS and UYI respectively and that piercing the corporate veil would require fraud and/or deceit. The respondents’ opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to succeed against Helen Lee but Dr Chen was adamant that there was sufficient evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In the morning of 17 October 2012, the second respondent met Dr Chen and advised him of the difficulties in his case and also the urgency to commence action before the limitation period set in. The second respondent also advised that UYI could not be sued as it had been struck off and that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the appellant’s claim. However, Dr Chen instructed that an action be commenced against only Helen Lee so as to stop the claim from being time-barred. It was in these circumstances that the respondents commenced HC/S 896/2012 (“the Original Suit”) against Helen Lee that same evening. It was not disputed that there was urgency in filing the Original Suit as the action would become time-barred the following day (GD at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In April 2013, Helen Lee filed an application to strike out the appellant’s claim in the Original Suit (“the Striking Out Application”). The Striking Out Application was allowed by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) who held that the claim against Helen Lee could not succeed because it would require the piercing of the corporate veil of IRS and/or UYI and this was not adequately pleaded. Moreover, there was no evidence to suggest that the corporate veil could be pierced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Following the AR’s decision, the respondents recommended to the appellant not to appeal to a Judge of the High Court.

</div> The appellant also sought repayment of the legal fees charged by the respondents as well as the $3,500 paid by the appellant to Helen Lee for the costs of the Striking Out Application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The trial proceeded on the basis of the appellant’s case as pleaded and particularised in the SOC and the F&amp;BP. In the GD, the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) dealt with the appellant’s claims along these lines. As the Judge summarised it, the appellant’s case at trial, both as to the respondents’ negligent advice and negligent conduct of the suit, was intertwined with its central argument that the respondents’ advice fell short in that they advised the appellant that it could not sue IRS and/or UYI and they failed to consider and advise on the possibility of making an application under s 343 of the Companies Act to restore IRS and/or UYI, followed by an application under s 340 of the said Act to impose personal liability on Helen Lee: GD at [30] and [33].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Judge dismissed the Negligence Suit in its entirety as he held that none of the allegations of negligence was made out by the appellant. The Judge also held that even if there was negligence on the respondents’ part, the appellant could not prove that it had suffered loss, commenting that the appellant’s claims on the amount of its alleged loss were weak and unsubstantiated (GD at [98]). The appellant’s claim on its alleged losses changed significantly as the matter proceeded. In the Original Suit, the appellant asserted that it had suffered loss of profits amounting to $43.2m due to Helen Lee’s fraudulent misrepresentations. The amount was then changed to about $115m. In the Negligence Suit, the amount swung from about $2m to $4.5m. The appellant then filed two valuation reports which estimated its loss of profits at about $9m and from $3.1bn to $8.9bn respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Judge found that the respondents had considered adequately the possibility of reinstating IRS and UYI to the register of companies, that the respondents had acted reasonably in the light of the impending time bar, that they had advised the appellant of the weakness of its case and that the merits of invoking ss 343 and 340 of the Companies Act were questionable in any case (the GD at [40]–[46]). The respondents had also asked the appellant to consider seeking legal representation by other law firms. The Judge also found that the respondents had highlighted to the appellant that there was insufficient evidence to prove fraud and/or deceit on the part of Helen Lee and had asked persistently for more evidence from the appellant. However, the appellant did not provide adequate instructions to allow the respondents to present a stronger case in the Original Suit (GD at [50]–[72]). The Judge therefore held that the appellant had failed to prove negligence on the respondents’ part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Judge also held that the appellant had not shown that it had a substantial chance of success in the Original Suit. This was because it was questionable whether UYI and IRS could have been reinstated under s 343 Companies Act before the time bar set in (GD at [85]–[86]). There was also no authority for the proposition that reinstatement of a company that had been struck off the register would confer validity retrospectively on an action commenced at the time when that company did not have a legal status. The appellant also could not show that the necessary elements to establish Helen Lee’s personal liability under s 340 Companies Act could be satisfied (the GD at [91]–[92]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge further held that the appellant could not prove its loss. First, neither of the valuations of the appellant’s loss of profits was reliable (the GD at [101]–[102]). Second, the appellant could not show that Helen Lee, IRS and UYI could satisfy any award in its favour (GD at [103]). Third, since the respondents had complied with the appellant’s instructions and did not breach their duty of care, the Judge dismissed the appellant’s claim for the legal fees that it had paid to the respondents for the Original Suit (GD at [104]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Finally, towards the end of the GD and just before the Judge dealt with the issue of costs, the Judge made the following comments in a single paragraph at [105] under the heading “Miscellaneous”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It appeared to me that parties took the view that the claim against [Helen Lee] for fraudulent misrepresentation in [the Original Suit] required a piercing of the corporate veil.

It contended that it was abundantly clear from the respondents’ conduct of the Original Suit and the second respondent’s evidence at the Negligence Suit that the respondents were unaware of the possibility of making Helen Lee personally liable for her torts pursuant to the DPL Principle and that this clearly constituted negligence on their part.

</div> The limitation period for a claim in negligence arising from this would have expired by 13 May 2019. However, the appellant’s application in SUM 23 was filed only on 18 February 2020. As this court explained in <span class="font-italic">Multistar</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd v Geocon Piling &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 2 SLR 1 at [32]–[34], the threshold question in determining whether such an amendment to pleadings should be allowed was whether it would introduce a new cause of action. This was the key point of contention in the parties’ supplemental submissions. However, we decided that there was no need for us to deal with this issue in the light of our view explained below that the appellant should not be allowed to pursue an entirely new case on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 SUM 23 comprised two related applications. They were for leave to raise a new point on appeal and for leave to amend the SOC to plead the same. The considerations which apply in the court’s exercise of its discretion to grant both these applications are broadly similar: see <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> v American Express Bank Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 (“<span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span>”) at [59]. The essential question in both cases is whether the opposing party is unduly prejudiced by the raising of a new point or a totally new case against it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In an application for leave to raise a new point on appeal, a key question is whether the new point effectively turns solely on questions of law or whether it raises new issues of fact. The applicable principles were summarised in the recent decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Abhilash</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Kunchian Krishnan v Yeo Hock Huat and another</span> [2019] 1 SLR 873 (“<span class="font-italic">Abhilash</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 The principles governing the granting of leave to raise new points on appeal were considered by this court in <span class="font-italic">Feoso</span><span class="font-italic"> (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Faith Maritime Co Ltd</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 556 (“<span class="font-italic">Feoso</span>”), which at [28] endorsed the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Connecticut Fire Insurance Company v Kavanagh</span> [1892] AC 473 at 480:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When a <span class="font-italic">question of law</span> is raised for the first time in a court of last resort, upon the construction of a document, or upon facts either admitted or proved beyond controversy, it is not only competent but expedient, in the interests of justice, to entertain the plea. … But their Lordships have no hesitation in holding that the course ought not, in any case, to be followed, unless the Court is satisfied that the evidence upon which they are asked to decide establishes beyond doubt that the facts, if fully investigated, would have supported the new plea.

Further, the mere fact that the new point sought to be raised <span class="font-italic">contradicts </span>the case as pleaded below would not invariably lead to the denial of leave. We explained that in <span class="font-italic">Feoso</span>, leave was denied not merely because the new point contradicted the appellant’s pleaded case, but, more importantly, because further findings might well have been made or raised had the arguments been raised below. In such a case, the court would thus be “deprived of any findings and reasoning” of the court below (at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41 … [In <span class="font-italic">Grace Electrical</span>] we concluded by stating that the following principles would apply when considering whether leave should be granted to introduce new points on appeal (at [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]hether a party is granted leave under O 57 r 9A(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) … will be the subject of careful consideration in each case, having due regard to factors including (a) the nature of the parties’ arguments below; (b) whether the court had considered and provided any findings and reasoning in relation to the new point; (c) whether further submissions, evidence, or findings would have been necessitated had the new points been raised below; and (d) any prejudice that might result to the counterparty in the appeal if leave were to be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">Abhilash</span>, the new points on appeal related to the probative value of an offer by a third party in the context of a valuation exercise. Those points were characterised by the court as “essentially … <span class="font-italic">questions of law</span>” [emphasis in original] which could be decided without further evidence (at [42]). The court therefore allowed those points to be pursued. A very different balance will be struck where the new argument to be raised on appeal would involve issues of fact, where it is almost inevitable that the failure to raise the point at trial had resulted in relevant evidence not being fully ventilated. This was the case in <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span>, where on appeal, the appellant sought to make the fresh allegation that a third party owed her fiduciary duties and had breached those duties. This court did not allow the new point to be raised. It summarised the relevant considerations as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 Arguably the most frequently cited (and authoritative) rendition of the principle governing the introduction of a new point of law on appeal is that expressed by Lord Herschell in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">The Owners of the Ship “Tasmania” and the Owners of the Freight v Smith and others, The Owners of the Ship “City of Corinth”, The Tasmania</span> (1890) 15 LR App Cas 223 (at 225):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A] point such as this, not taken at the trial, and presented for the first time in the Court of Appeal, ought to be most jealously scrutinised.

And it is obvious that no care is exercised in the elucidation of facts not material to them.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It appears to me that under these circumstances a Court of Appeal ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a ground there put forward for the first time, if it is satisfied beyond doubt, <span class="font-italic">first, that it has</span><span class="font-italic"> before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as completely as would have been the case if the controversy had arisen at the trial; and next that no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned if an opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the witness box</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 … Lord Birkenhead LC’s carefully measured caveat in <span class="font-italic">North Staffordshire Railway Company v Edge </span>[1920] AC 254 at 263–264, also merits very close attention and adherence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]here are very few cases of which it can be confidently stated that a failure to raise a relevant contention at the appropriate stage will not prejudice the other litigant. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I desire to draw attention to a consideration which in my view is both more general and more important. … To acquiesce in such an attempt as the appellants have made in this case is in effect to undertake decisions which may be of the highest importance without having received any assistance at all from the judges in the Courts below. … <span class="font-italic">[S]</span><span class="font-italic">uch attempts must be vigilantly examined and seldom indulged.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 It is axiomatic that the “interests of justice” must be afforded a wider scope than to just merely encompass one party’s (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the appellant’s) expectation of “justice”. … It has to be emphasised that finality in litigation is usually as much in the interests of justice as a party’s interest in succeeding in its claim. … [T]he legitimate expectations of the respondent here are that the case should be resolved on the basis of arguments presented and evidence adduced in the court below, and not on newly minted arguments that require further testimony and forensic examination<span class="font-italic">.</span> Plainly there will be a grave and altogether understandable sense of palpable injustice felt by a respondent if a verdict is reversed on grounds that ought to have been raised earlier and could perhaps have been addressed by contrary evidence at the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In the present case, we assume, without deciding, that the DPL Principle enunciated by the Judge was a correct statement of the existing law. On this basis, it was clear that if we were to entertain the appellant’s new case on appeal, we would not have all the relevant evidence and findings of fact before us. The respondents have not been asked whether they considered the DPL Principle and if not, why not. If that principle were found to be applicable, would the available evidence be sufficient to find Helen Lee liable? All these gaps in the appellant’s case before us would have been extremely prejudicial to the respondents who were told to defend a totally different case at the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It must be emphasised that the appellant’s case on appeal sought to do much more than merely raise an additional legal point in support of its appeal against the decision of the Judge. It was actually seeking to discard the entire basis on which its case proceeded during the three days of trial and to begin afresh with a new allegation of negligence before us. Even if it could be argued that the existing para 16(viii) of the SOC was sufficiently wide to encompass the new allegation of negligence anyway, the appellant had confined the scope of this pleading by its F&amp;BP to a case based on either the piercing of the corporate veil or on liability under ss 340 and 343 of the Companies Act. This was further confirmed by the evidence adduced and the submissions made at trial. We would not know how the Judge would have decided this entirely new case because it was never before him and all the views and findings in his GD were premised on facts and arguments that have now been abandoned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In addition to the issue of prejudice to the respondents, there was also the issue of abuse of the appeal process. The appeal before us would certainly not be an appeal arising from dissatisfaction with the Judge’s decision (as the appellant was not even going to address the GD) but would essentially be an appeal arising from dissatisfaction with the way the appellant’s previous counsel conducted the entire case in the High Court. In reality, there would be no appeal at all because the Court of Appeal would not be considering whether the Judge was wrong or otherwise in reaching the conclusions set out in his GD. Instead, the Court of Appeal would be effectively conducting a second trial. We have reminded counsel in various previous appeals that they should not be coming before the Court of Appeal as if it were a second trial court and we hope we do not need to sound the same admonition against such abuse of the appeal process for future appeals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As this court made clear in <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span>, an appellate court should be slow to come to the conclusion that there was no need for new issues of fact to be canvassed at trial on the basis that no satisfactory explanation could have been offered in response to the relevant allegations even if they had been made at first instance (see <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span> at [47]–[48] set out at [29] above). Even if the parties had proceeded on agreed facts and only made submissions on specified questions of law, if the appellant decided to abandon the specified questions of law and to put forward new questions of law on appeal, that would also amount to abuse of the appeal process. This is again because the Court of Appeal would not be considering whether the Judge was wrong or otherwise in his decision but would instead be hearing arguments on an entirely new case for the first time. Such an unusual move by the appellant may be acceptable in a rare situation where the case law here or elsewhere has undergone significant developments or the relevant statutory provisions have changed between the time of the Judge’s decision and the appeal. The present case was nowhere near such a situation. The appellant’s application in SUM 23 to amend its SOC and to change its entire case on appeal should therefore not be allowed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Just as a matter of discussion and without expressing any view on the merits of the appellant’s claims, it was conceivable that there might be a plausible explanation for the respondents not to have conducted the Original Suit on the basis of Helen Lee’s personal liability for her alleged torts. The pleadings in the Original Suit were clearly aimed at recovering the loss of profits allegedly suffered by the appellant due to its inability to distribute Immunotec Products under the UYI Distributorship Agreement.

</div>
</div> This was also the basis on which the appellant put forward the Negligence Suit at trial, as evidenced by its valuation of the loss of profits allegedly suffered. This was a measure of loss based on the benefits that the appellant would have obtained if the UYI Distributorship Agreement had been performed. Such a measure of loss might not be available to the appellant in a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against Helen Lee, particularly since she was not a party to the contract on the face of the agreement. Indeed, the appellant, advised by its new counsel on appeal, appeared to recognise this as its claim on loss was reduced dramatically on appeal to $196,524.35, said to be its operating loss for 2006. The logic behind this new valuation of loss was that the appellant had been incorporated for the specific purpose of the IRS (and subsequently the UYI) Distributorship Agreement and therefore the appellant would not have suffered the operating loss if Helen Lee had not made the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Tay Yong Kwang JA):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>CoA dismisses the appellant’s application to run an entirely new case on appeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Court of Appeal reiterates that to approach the Court of Appeal as if it were a second trial court would be an abuse of the appeal process (at <strong>[32]</strong>).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p><span>1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>This was an appeal against the High Court’s dismissal of the appellant’s claims in HC/S 992/2015 (“the Negligence Suit”).</p>
<p><strong>Background to the appeal</strong></p>
<p><span>2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The respondents were the appellant’s counsel in HC/S 896/2012 (“the Original Suit”). The Original Suit was struck out by an Assistant Registrar. The appellant then commenced the Negligence Suit against the respondents, alleging that the respondents were negligent in their advice to the appellant and in their conduct of the Original Suit. Following a trial, the High Court dismissed the Negligence Suit in its entirety.</p>
<p><span>3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>On appeal, the appellant’s new counsel indicated that it would not be dealing with the findings made by the High Court. Instead, it sought to rely on a single new allegation of negligence against the respondents which was not raised during the trial. The appellant applied by way of CA/SUM 23/2020 (“SUM 23”) to seek leave from the Court of Appeal to raise this new point on appeal and to amend its Statement of Claim to plead the new allegation.</p>
<p><strong>The Court of Appeal’s decision</strong></p>
<p><span>4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The appellant’s case on appeal sought to do more than merely raise an additional legal point; it sought to discard the entire basis on which its case proceeded during the trial and to begin afresh with a new allegation of negligence. If the Court of Appeal were to entertain the appellant’s new case, it would not have all the relevant evidence and findings of fact before it. The gaps in the appellant’s case would have been extremely prejudicial to the respondents who were told to defend a totally different case at the trial: at <strong>[30]</strong> and <strong>[31]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Such an appeal would also be an abuse of the appeal process. The Court of Appeal would not be considering whether the High Court was wrong in its conclusions, but would be effectively conducting a second trial: at <strong>[32]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>For the above reasons, SUM 23 was dismissed. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed as well as there would be nothing for the appellant to proceed on: at <strong>[35]</strong>.</p>
