<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by way of Registrar’s
                    Appeal No 488 of 2010 (“the Appeal”) against the decision of
                    the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”), who had struck out the
                    Originating Summons No 994 of 2010 (“the OS”) filed by Tan
                    Eng Hong (“Tan”) on the application of the Attorney-General
                    (“the AG”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Tan had been jointly charged with another person
                    in District Arrest Case No 41402 of 2010 (“DAC 41402/2010”) for an
                    offence under s 377A (“the charge”) of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”). Tan subsequently filed the OS on
                    24 September 2010 under O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“the Rules”) to challenge the constitutionality of s 377A
                    under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Constitution”) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Section 377A of the Penal Code was inconsistent
                            with Article 9 of the Constitution and was therefore void by virtue of
                            Article 4 of the Constitution (“Art 4”);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Section 377A was inconsistent with Articles 12 and
                            14 of the Constitution (“Art 12 and 14”) and was therefore
                            void by virtue of Art 4.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    For those reasons, the charge brought against Tan
                            under s 377A was void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 15 October 2010, during a pre-trial
                    conference at the Subordinate Courts, state counsel for the AG informed Tan that
                    the charge against him had been amended to one under s 294(a) of the Penal Code
                    (“the amended charge”). The AG then applied under Summons No 5063
                    of 2010 (“the striking-out application”) pursuant to O 18 r 19 of
                    the Rules to strike out the OS. The AR granted the striking-out application on 7
                    December 2010 resulting in this Appeal. A week later, Tan pleaded guilty to the
                    amended charge. He was convicted and fined $3,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In order to determine if the AR’s decision
                    was correct, the court needs to look at the applicable principles in three areas
                    of law <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     striking out;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>locus
                            standi</em> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     the requirements for the granting of declaratory
                        relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In brief, pleadings can be struck out under O 18
                    r 19 of the Rules on the ground that: (i) it discloses no reasonable cause of
                    action; (ii) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; (iii) it may prejudice,
                    embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or (iv) it is otherwise an
                    abuse of the process of the Court. The burden is on the applicant to prove a
                    very clear case that one of the grounds in O 18 r 19 applies (<em>per AG of Duchy of Lancaster v London and North Western Railway
                        Co</em> [1892] 3 Ch 274) as can be seen from the following
                    cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     An action may be struck out under the
                        “no reasonable cause of action” ground as being without legal
                        basis where an aggrieved party is unable to establish <em>locus standi</em> (see <em>Abdul Razak Ahmad v
                            Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru</em> [1995] 2 MLJ
                    287.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     According to
                        Yong Pung How CJ in <em>Goh Koon Suan v Heng Gek
                            Kiau</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 705 at [15], an action is clearly
                        vexatious in the following situations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...when the party bringing it is not acting <em>bona
                                fide</em>, and merely wishes to annoy or embarrass his
                            opponent, or when it is not calculated to lead to any practical
                            result.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">In <em>Chee Siok Chin &amp; Ors v Minister for Home
                            Affairs &amp; Anor</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at [33]
                            (“<em>Chee Siok Chin</em>”), V K
                        Rajah J elaborated on the “frivolous and vexatious”
                        ground:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Proceedings are frivolous when they are deemed to waste the
                            court’s time, and are determined to be incapable of legally
                            sustainable and reasoned argument. Proceedings are vexatious when they
                            are shown to be <em>without foundation</em> and/or
                            where they <em>cannot possibly succeed</em> and/or
                            where an action is brought only for annoyance or to gain some fanciful
                            advantage. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Rajah J in
                            <em>Chee Siok Chin</em> also classified the abuse
                        of process ground into four categories (at [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    proceedings which involve a deception on the
                                court…;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   proceedings where the process of the court is
                                not being fairly or honestly used but is employed for some ulterior
                                or improper purpose or in an improper way;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   proceedings which are manifestly groundless
                                or without foundation or which serve no useful
                            purpose;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   multiple or successive proceedings which
                                cause or are likely to cause improper vexation or
                            oppression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       If a court cannot grant a party declaratory
                    relief, it is arguable that the case is frivolous and vexatious, since it would
                    have no practical value. To decide whether it can indeed do so, the court should
                    consider the requirements for the granting of declaratory relief. In <em>Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another
                        appeal</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 at [14] (“<em>Karaha Bodas</em>”), Judith Prakash J summarised them as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the court must have jurisdiction and power to

                            controversy for the court to resolve;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(e)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">any person whose interests might be affected by
                            the declaration should be before the court; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(f)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">there must be some ambiguity or uncertainty about
                            the issue in respect of which the declaration is sought so that the
                            court’s determination would have the effect of laying such doubts
                            to rest.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       There is considerable overlap between the
                    principles relating to striking-out and the granting of declaratory relief. In
                    the light of this, this court will address the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Does Tan have <em>locus standi</em>?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Is there a real controversy?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     Is Tan’s claim certain to
                    fail?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     Does the court
                        have jurisdiction to declare s 377A of the Penal Code unconstitutional in
                        view of the fact Tan did not come to court by way of s 56A of the
                        Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the
                        SCA”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">
<em>Locus Standi</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on locus standi</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In <em>Government of Malaysia v
                        Lim Kit Siang</em> [1988] 2 MLJ 12 at 27 (“<em>Lim Kit Siang</em>”), the majority of the Malaysian Supreme
                    Court ruled that to possess <em>locus standi</em>, a
                    plaintiff must show that he has a private right that has been infringed. If a
                    public right is involved, he must show that he has suffered a peculiar damage as
                    a result of the alleged public act and that he has a genuine private interest to
                    protect or further. In <em>Lim Kit</em> Siang at p 21, the
                    majority had followed <em>Boyce v Paddington Borough
                        Council</em> [1903] 1 Ch 109, which the House of Lords accepted in
                        <em>Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers and
                        Others</em> [1978] AC 435.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Tan had argued that where constitutionally
                    guaranteed liberties are at stake, <em>locus standi</em> is
                    established simply by showing sufficient interest rather than substantial
                    interest. In support, his counsel cited <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin
                        &amp; Ors v Minister for Information and the Arts</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R)
                    294 (“<em>Colin Chan</em>”). There,
                    Karthigesu JA expounded:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    If a constitutional guarantee is to mean anything,
                            it must mean that any citizen can complain to the courts if there is a
                            violation of it. The fact that the violation would also affect every
                            other citizen should not detract from a citizen’s interest in
                            seeing that his constitutional rights are not violated. A citizen should
                            not have to wait until he is prosecuted before he may assert his
                            constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    There is thus no need for the appellants to show
                            that they are office holders in IBSA or members thereof. Their right to
                            challenge Order 405/1994 arises not from membership of any society.
                            Their right arises from every citizen’s right to profess, practise
                            and propagate his religious beliefs. If there was a breach of Art 15,
                            such a breach would affect the citizen <em>qua</em>
                            citizen. If a citizen does not have <em>sufficient
                                interest</em> to see that his constitutional rights are not
                            violated, then it is hard to see who has.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Colin Chan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Before applying the test to the case, one must
                    first be clear as to the proposition that <em>Colin
                        Chan</em> stands for. Contrary to the submissions of Tan’s
                    counsel, it is not immediately obvious from Karthigesu JA’s passing
                    reference to “sufficient interest”, that he was articulating a
                    test akin to its English counterpart. Academics Kevin Tan and Thio Li-Ann
                    (“Tan and Thio”) have gone even further than Tan’s counsel.
                    In <em>Constitutional Law in Malaysia and Singapore</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2010) at p 551, they wrote,
                    “Where constitutionally- guaranteed liberties are at stake, <em>locus standi</em> is established without the need to show
                    sufficiency of interest” before making reference to <em>Colin Chan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     A more defensible interpretation is that
                    Karthigesu JA was simply treating constitutional rights as being vested in every
                    citizen. He was not articulating a new test that specifically applied to
                    constitutional rights. Instead, he simply preferred applying the
                    “substantial interest” test instead of the “special
                    damage” test that is used for public rights and had ruled that the former
                    was satisfied in <em>Colin Chan</em>. This interpretation
                    was supported by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Eng
                        Foong Ho and Ors v Attorney-General</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 542
                        (“<em>Eng Foong Ho</em>”). If <em>Colin Chan</em> had articulated a new <em>locus standi</em> requirement for constitutional rights, the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Eng Foong Ho</em> might have been expected to
                    have made reference to it. That the Court of Appeal did not do so strongly
                    suggests <em>Colin Chan</em> is no authority for
                    Tan’s proposition of a lower test of <em>locus
                        standi</em> for constitutional rights. This is further supported by
                    the Chief Justice’s speech to students from the Singapore Management
                    University (reproduced in the article <em>Judicial Review –
                        From Angst to Empathy</em> (2010) 22 SAcLJ 469 (“SMU
                    Lecture”), where Chan Sek Keong CJ noted at para 33:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…In Singapore, although the courts appear to have accepted the same
                        ‘sufficient interest’ test to determine whether leave for
                        judicial review should be granted, that is not, in my view, also to say that
                        our courts will apply the test with the same rigour as the UK courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In so far as the test of Tan and Thio may be
                    taken as saying being a citizen in itself gives one <em>locus
                        standi</em>, this should be rejected. Even Lord Denning, who attempted
                    many times to liberalise the rules on locus standi in England, opined in
                        <em>R. v Greater London Council Ex p Blackburn</em>
                    [1976] 1 WLR 550 at 559 that <em>locus standi</em> should
                    be denied to “mere busybodies”. To allow people to challenge an
                    allegedly unconstitutional law simply because they are citizens is undesirable
                    for various reasons. First, priority should be given to parties with a genuine
                    dispute. Second, as Salleh Abas LP commented in <em>Lim Kit
                        Siang</em> at p 25, a sufficiently robust threshold will ensure the
                    courts do not adjudicate upon politically motivated litigation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…In my judgment, the court should be slow to respond to a
                        politically motivated litigation unless the claimant can show that his
                        private rights as a citizen are affected. Similar caution was expressed by
                        Salmon LJ in Blackburn’s case [1971] 1 WLR 1037 saying that he
                        deprecated ‘litigations the purpose of which is to influence political
                        decisions’. Thus as a politician, the respondent’s remedy in
                        this matter does not lie with the court, but with Parliament and the
                        electorate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated
                        v Commonwealth of Australia and Others</em> (1980) 146 CLR 493 at 530,
                    Gibbs J ruled:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A belief, however strongly felt, that the law generally or a particular
                        law should be observed or that conduct of a particular kind should be
                        prevented, does not suffice to give its possessor <em>locus
                            standi</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Constitutional rights are not mere rhetoric for a low <em>locus standi</em> test of citizenship to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     
          <em>Colin Chan</em>,
                    therefore, should not be seen as introducing a new test of <em>locus standi</em> for constitutional cases. Instead, it should be
                    interpreted as merely saying that to satisfy the “substantial
                    interest” test, a putative litigant has to allege a violation of his
                    constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Are there constitutional rights at stake in order for Colin Chan to
                apply?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Regardless of which interpretation the court
                    takes of <em>Colin Chan</em>, it will only be applicable if
                    constitutional rights are involved. This necessitates investigating whether Arts
                    9, 12 and 14 of the Constitution are in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Article 9(1) states: “No person shall
                    be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.”
                    Article 9(1) is engaged only if expansive definitions are made of
                    “life” and “personal liberty”, such that a citizen
                    has the liberty to lead his life as he pleases. However, our courts have
                    eschewed such wide interpretations. For example, Choo Han Teck J in <em>Lo Pui Sang v Mamata Kapildev Dav and Ors (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd
                        intervener)</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 754 at [6] (“<em>Lo Pui Sang</em>”) said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…I do not think that the phrase ‘personal liberty’ in
                        Art 9 was a reference to a right of personal liberty to contract. It has
                        always been understood to refer only to the personal liberty of the person
                        against unlawful incarceration or detention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, Art 9 of the Constitution has not been triggered. It should
                    be noted that <em>Lo Pui Sang</em> was overturned on appeal
                    to the Court of Appeal. However, the Court of Appeal did not consider the
                    constitutional issues that the High Court had considered, see <em>Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners
                        Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 at
                    [53].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Article 12(1) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection
                        of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to the Court of Appeal in <em>Yong Vui Kong v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2010] 3 SLR 489 at [109]
                    (applying <em>Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2005] 1 SLR(R) 103 at [70]), s 377A’s differentiating measure would be
                    consistent with Art 12(1) only if: (a) the classification was founded on an
                    intelligible differentia; and (b) the differentia bears a rational relation to
                    the object sought to be achieved by the law in question. On the arguments alone,
                    this court is of the opinion that Tan’s case does engage Art 12(1).
                    Although s 377A is founded on an intelligible differentia (because it applies to
                    sexually-active male homosexuals), it is arguable that there is no social
                    objective that can be furthered by criminalising male but not female homosexual
                    intercourse. Therefore, <em>Colin Chan</em> should
                    apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Article 14 guarantees a citizen’s
                    freedom of speech, assembly and association. Although Tan referred to Art 14 in
                    his Notice of Appeal, his counsel made no written submissions on this ground.
                    Consequently, there is no necessity to address it here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What constitutes an injury or violation of constitutional
                rights?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Since Art 12 was involved, <em>Colin Chan</em> applied. Tan needed to show he had suffered an injury
                    or violation of his constitutional rights. The AG had argued that with the
                    charge being dropped, Tan was unable to prove his case. This was a mistaken
                    view. While the act of prosecution itself can be a violation of one’s
                    constitutional rights, it does not follow that a violation cannot occur without
                    a prosecution. Karthigesu JA made this abundantly clear in <em>Colin Chan</em> at [13], “A citizen should not have to wait
                    until he is prosecuted before he may assert his constitutional
                    rights”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There were two ways Tan’s constitutional
                    rights may arguably have been violated. First, the presence of an
                    unconstitutional law on the statute books may suffice. The AG had sought to
                    distinguish <em>Colin Chan</em> on the basis that the
                    parties’ rights there were violated by the ban on certain materials, as
                    opposed to prosecution. The underlying premise – that the violation must
                    come from a physical act – was refuted by Karthigesu JA’s following
                    dicta in <em>Colin Chan</em> at [19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although we agree with the learned judge that the constitutional rights to
                        freedom of religion and expression would give the appellants <em>locus standi</em>, we are not able to agree with her that
                        the fact that the appellants were facing prosecution for being in possession
                        of prohibited publications under the Undesirable Publications Act also gives
                        them <em>locus standi</em>. We think that this is an
                        irrelevant consideration in an application for leave to issue <em>certiorari</em> proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The spectre of future prosecution was the
                    second way Tan’s rights could be said to have been infringed. This
                    argument was accepted by the High Court of Australia in <em>Croome and another v State of Tasmania</em> (1997) 142 ALR 397 at 402
                    and the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <em>Leung T C William Roy v
                        Secretary for Justice</em> [2006] HKLRD 211 at [29] (“<em>Leung T C William Roy</em>”), cases cited by
                    Tan’s counsel. Therefore, Tan’s claim should not be struck out on
                    the ground that he lacked <em>locus standi</em> although it
                    can be on other grounds dealt with below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In this court’s view, <em>Colin Chan</em> did not introduce a new test for the litigation of
                    constitutional rights. Nevertheless, it is arguable on the facts that
                    Tan’s constitutional rights may have been violated. Consequently, he had
                    satisfied the “substantial interest” test for <em>locus standi</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Real Controversy requirement</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Lord Dunedin in <em>The Russian
                        Commercial &amp; Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade</em>
                    [1921] 2 AC 438, stated the following at 448:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The question must be a real and not a theoretical question; the
                        person raising it must have a real interest to raise it; he must be able to
                        secure a proper contradictor, that is to say, someone presently existing who
                        has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Lim Kit Siang</em>
                    at p 27, Abdul Hamid CJ explained the requirement’s rationale as being
                    rooted in the common law’s adversarial system:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Self-interest is seen as the motivating force that will ensure
                        that the parties present their respective positions in the best possible
                        light. If the motivation of self-interest is non-existent so that the
                        ensuing dispute is not with respect to contested rights and obligations of
                        the parties themselves, then the assurance of diligent preparation and
                        argument cannot exist….</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is for the reason that there was no real
                    controversy in issue here that this court affirms the decision made below and
                    upholds the striking-out order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     There was no real controversy here because
                    while there were specific facts involving specific parties, the facts were
                    merely hypothetical. Granted, there were identifiable parties with the
                    “motivation of self-interest” to make the diligent preparation
                    identified by Abdul Hamid CJ as being essential to the adversarial trial. This
                    however is insufficient. In <em>Salijah bte Ab Latef v Mohd Irwan
                        bin Abdullah Teo</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 80 at [60], Yong Pung How CJ
                    held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The primary consideration in this appeal is whether there is a real
                        contest of the legal rights. The editors of Zamir and Woolf have identified
                        one rationale for the reluctance of the courts to deal with theoretical
                        issues - that it distracts the courts from deciding real, subsisting
                        problems. A stronger reason is that if there is in fact no real issue
                        subsisting, then the matter would not be <em>res
                            judicata</em>, nor the issue merged in judgment. In that event, it
                        would be open for the issue to be reopened again and again. The need for the
                        existence of a contested dispute is to ensure that there is finality in the
                        court's judgments as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Tan had relied on <em>Leung T C
                        William Roy</em> to support his argument. There, the Hong Kong Court
                    of Appeal (at [28]) accepted there could be adjudication on hypothetical facts,
                    but only in exceptional cases. The AG sought to distinguish this case on the
                    basis that it revolved around the International Covenant on Civil and Political
                    Rights, which Hong Kong has incorporated into its laws. The treaty has no force
                    of law in Singapore. There are other reasons not to follow the case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Hong Kong court’s
                        criterion of “exceptional cases” was vague. There is a danger
                        that constitutional challenges may be brought willy-nilly and accepted
                        blindly under this amorphous phrase. Of course, this may be negated if there
                        are principled ways to carving out an exception. However, an exceptional
                        case, by nature, cannot be defined in order to provide guidance by
                        precedent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Hong Kong court reasoned that access to justice can only be gained by the
                        applicant breaking the law. It referred to the opinion of Advocate-General
                        Jacobs in <em>Union de Pequenos Agricultores v Council of the
                            European Union</em> [2003] QB 893 at [43]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... Individuals clearly cannot be required to breach the law in order
                            to gain access to justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">In Singapore, it is arguable that individuals are not compelled to
                        resort to such extremes. They can request the President to refer the issue
                        to the Constitutional Tribunal under Art 100 of the Constitution. As there
                        is an established procedure through which guidance may be obtained in the
                        absence of specific facts, there is no reason to relax the “real
                        controversy” requirement in order to avoid the situation where
                        individuals break the law in order to obtain standing. It should be noted,
                        however, that Chan CJ’s extra-judicial view was that Art 100 of the
                        Constitution was not intended to apply to hypothetical disputes (SMU
                        Lecture). The basis for his view was that Art 100 was enacted in 1994 to
                        deal with a specific dispute between organs of state. The following portion
                        of his speech merits quotation (SMU Lecture at para 4):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…Article 100 was enacted for the purpose of resolving actual
                            and potential disputes of a similar nature between constitutional
                            organs, and not to obtain advisory opinions on hypothetical cases from
                            the courts…</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     Further, there
                        was nothing at stake for Tan. It bears remembering that Tan had already
                        pleaded guilty and had been convicted under s 294 of the Penal Code. In
                        bringing the OS, he stood to benefit from a judicial declaration that s 377A
                        is unconstitutional while suffering no prejudice, leaving aside the matter
                        of costs. This arguably goes against the spirit of the adversarial process
                        where the parties’ conduct is conditioned by the possibility of gain
                        and/or loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Given that the charge was dropped, there are
                    no subsisting facts upon which there can be <em>res
                        judicata</em>. Hence, it may be argued that Tan’s claim has no
                    real practical value and should therefore be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Certainty of failure</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Court of Appeal in <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin &amp;
                        Ors</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [21] emphasised that a high threshold
                    of failure must be met before it would strike out a claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…As long as the statement of claim discloses some cause of action,
                        or raises some question fit to be decided at the trial, the mere fact that
                        the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it
                        out...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Similarly, in <em>The Tokai
                        Maru</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 646 at [44], the Court of Appeal
                    held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…A reasonable defence means one which has some chance of success
                        when only the allegations in the pleadings are considered: <em>per</em> Lord Pearson in <em>Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association</em> [1970] 1 All
                        ER 1094, cited with approval by Rubin J in <em>Active Timber
                            Agencies Pte Ltd v Allen &amp; Gledhill</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R)
                        334  . The hearing of the application should not therefore involve
                        a minute examination of the documents or the facts of the case in order to
                        see whether there is a reasonable defence. To do that is to usurp the
                        position of the trial judge and the result is a trial in chambers, on
                        affidavits only, without discovery and without oral evidence tested by
                        cross-examination in the ordinary way (see <em>Wenlock v
                            Moloney</em> [1965] 2 All ER 871). The mere fact that the defence
                        is weak and not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out, so long
                        as the pleadings raise some question to be decided by the court (see
                            <em>Attorney-General of The Duchy of Lancaster v London
                            and North Western Railway Co</em> [1892] 3 Ch 274). In short, the
                        defence has to be obviously unsustainable on its face to justify an
                        application to strike out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legal analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Having a high threshold is consistent with the
                    rationale of the striking-out procedure, that is to filter out claims where no
                    further investigation could provide any appreciable assistance to the task of
                    reaching a correct outcome. However, this case does not fall within the
                    category. Tan’s case was not completely without merit, especially on the
                    ground of Art 12. Furthermore, his case raised many novel issues that deserved
                    more detailed treatment, for example:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether an unconstitutional law in
                        itself can constitute an injury or violation to one’s constitutional
                        rights; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether Art 14 can encompass a right to express one’s homosexual
                        sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The AG had submitted that Tan was certain to
                    fail given that he had no <em>locus standi</em> to seek a
                    declaration that s 377A of the Penal Code contravened the Constitution. This
                    argument was dealt with under the issue of <em>locus
                        standi</em>. Here, the issue is whether the case is so weak, as
                    gleaned from the pleadings, that it should be struck out because the result is a
                    foregone conclusion. This threshold has not been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Judicial power and jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     To grant declaratory relief, the courts have
                    insisted that the declaration sought must be in relation to a vested right.
                    Judith Prakash J held in <em>Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina
                        Energy Trading Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... CPR Part 40.20 is the rule reflecting the English court's
                        power to grant declaratory reliefs. This is a new rule and it replaced the
                        old rule that was <em>in pari materia</em> with our O
                        15 r 16 which, as it may be recalled, reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">No action or other proceedings shall be open to objection on the
                            ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby,
                            and the Court may make binding declarations <em>of
                                right</em> whether or not any consequential relief is or could
                            be claimed…[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The new CPR Part 40.20 differs from the above provision in that it does
                        not state that a declaration has to be "of right". In Singapore, the
                        legislation concerning the power to grant declaratory reliefs still includes
                        the requirement that the declaration be one of right. This restriction has
                        been taken out of the English provisions and the English courts therefore,
                        arguably, have more wide-ranging powers than we do. When Lord Diplock made
                        his famous pronouncement in <em>Gouriet</em>, the
                        legislation in force was identical to our O 15 r 16. That same identical
                        provision was in force (and the exact wording was set out in the judgment)
                        when Neill LJ held in <em>Meadows</em> that he was
                        bound by Lord Diplock's holding. As a matter of construction of the court's
                        powers, therefore, as far as the Singapore courts are concerned, the
                        approach of Lord Diplock is as authoritative as it ever was. This approach
                        was adopted by the local cases of <em>Salijah</em>
                            (<a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> <em>supra</em>) and <em>British &amp;
                            Malayan Trustees</em> (<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>) where the court agreed that a
                        declaration should only be granted when it concerned the rights of the
                        parties represented in the litigation. We found no compelling reason to
                        change that position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Selvam J explained the reason for this
                    requirement in <em>Singapore Airlines Limited &amp; Anor v The
                        Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore &amp; the Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 1097 at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That provision [Rules of Court O 15 r 16] does not mean that declaratory
                        orders can be sought by all and sundry irrespective of whether there was a
                        justiciable issue between the parties. It can be sought only by persons who
                        have a right to enforce against a defendant or by persons who say that he
                        himself is not liable. It is not the function or purpose of the courts to
                        render legal opinion to indirect parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This requirement has been satisfied on the
                    facts since constitutional rights are vested in each person and those of Tan had
                    been affected. The next step is to determine whether Tan had committed an abuse
                    of process by not referring the constitutional issue to the High Court under s
                    56A of the SCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was avoiding s 56A of the SCA an abuse of process?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     This was the last ground of the AG’s
                    arguments that Tan’s claim should be struck out as an abuse of process.
                    Section 56A(1) of the SCA (“s 56A(1)”) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where in any proceedings in a subordinate court a question arises as to
                        the interpretation or effect of any provision of the Constitution, the court
                        hearing the proceedings may stay the proceedings on such terms as may be
                        just to await the decision of the question on the reference to the High
                        Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Before proceeding further, it should be noted
                    that (as the AG pointed out), s 56A had been repealed since 2 January 2011
                        (<em>vide</em> s 430 of the Criminal Procedure Code
                    2010 (Act No 15 of 2010) (“the CPC 2010”) read with para 105(c) of
                    the Sixth Schedule of the same Act and para 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code
                    (Commencement) Notification 2010 (S776/2010)). The Criminal Procedure Code 2010
                    has an equivalent provision in s 395 of the CPC 2010. Section 56A is
                    nevertheless applicable in the present case. The CPC 2010 has a transitional
                    provision which is s 429 CPC 2010. Section 429(2) of the CPC 2010 provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)   This Code shall not affect —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)  any inquiry, trial or other
                        proceeding commenced or pending under the repealed Code before the
                        appointed day, and every such inquiry, trial or other proceeding may be
                        continued and everything in relation thereto may be done in all
                        respects after that day as if this Code had not been enacted;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)  any further proceedings which
                        may be taken under the repealed Code in respect of any inquiry,
                        trial or other proceeding which has commenced or is pending before
                        the appointed day, and such further proceedings may be taken and
                        everything in relation thereto may be done in all respects after that
                        day as if this Code had not been enacted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The “appointed day” referred to under s 429(2)(<em>a</em>) of the CPC 2010 is 2 January 2011 (see s 429(25), CPC
                    2010 read with para 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Commencement) Notification
                    2010 (S776/2010)). DAC 41402/2010 was commenced before 2 January 2011.
                    Accordingly, the relevant provision for the court to consider is s
                56A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Returning to the issue of whether avoidance of
                    s 56A is an abuse of process, four questions should be considered. The first one
                    is whether s 56A even applies in the first place. In <em>Ng Chye
                        Huey and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 106 the
                    court held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    ...These jurisdictional rules are essential to the
                            orderly conduct of litigation in our courts. Without a sufficiently
                            clear delineation of the respective spheres of dominion of each level of
                            our hierarchy of our courts, chaos would inevitably result as parties
                            seek, willy-nilly and solely for their own advantage, to bring their
                            applications before different levels of court in an instrumental,
                            haphazard and legally unprincipled fashion</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57    ...Litigants should not be allowed the luxury of
                            ‘switching’ their cases between the criminal and civil
                            realms with complete impunity. To allow parties to successfully mount
                            such arguments would encourage future resort of unorthodox and
                            objectionable manoeuvres in the hope of circumventing onerous procedural
                            requirements...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Tan had argued that s 56A did not apply because there were no
                    existing criminal proceedings in place. That argument can be countered by the
                    fact that criminal proceedings were ongoing at the time Tan applied to challenge
                    the constitutionality of s 377A. Therefore, s 56A did apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, even if s 56A applied, was it
                    exclusive? In other words, was it the only means by which a constitutional
                    question may be raised in Subordinate Court proceedings? There is no clear
                    evidence that Parliament’s intention was for s 56A to be the exclusive
                    mode for raising constitutional questions arising in the course of criminal
                    proceedings in the Subordinate Courts. When debating the Subordinate Courts
                    (Amendment) Bill, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 April
                    1993) Vol 61 at column 132, Professor S Jayakumar had commented:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finally, Sir, clause 22 empowers a Subordinate Court to refer any
                        constitutional issue arising in an action before it to the High Court for
                        determination. This is only right because a Subordinate Court is not the
                        appropriate forum to determine such an issue. Provision is made for the
                        Attorney-General to be heard on any such issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Yong Pung How CJ noted in <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin and
                        Others v Public Prosecutor</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 209 at
                    [8]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A crucial aspect of this case was the fact that the lower court was a
                        Subordinate Court and this court was of course now sitting as an appellate
                        court. The jurisdiction of the District Court was limited, as there was no
                        provision in the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) which was equivalent to
                        para 1 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap
                        322) ("SCJA") which conferred upon the High Court the power of judicial
                        review. As such, the District Court could not have determined the
                        constitutional issues raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Professor Jayakumar and Yong CJ’s words only go to show why it
                    is necessary to make a constitutional reference – because the Subordinate
                    Courts lack the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon such matters. There was no
                    mention that the reference procedure is exclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Then again, despite there being no clear
                    evidence, it is arguable that a purposive reading of s 56A and its related
                    case-law indicates an exclusive regime. Tay Yong Kwang J ruled in <em>Johari bin Kanadi and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR(R) 422 at [9] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…This discretion, properly exercised after judicial consideration
                        of the merits of the application, will prevent unnecessary delay and
                        possible abuse every time a party in the proceedings purports to raise an
                        issue of constitutional interpretation and effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     This purported role of the Subordinate Courts
                    as the gatekeeper for constitutional issues arising in its proceedings would be
                    rendered nugatory if the s 56A regime was not mandatory and
                    exclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The third question is even if s 56A is
                    exclusive, was Tan’s error in not making a s 56A application remediable?
                    On the one hand, O 2 r 1(3) of the Rules provides that the court is not to set
                    aside an originating process merely on the basis that it was not the proper one.
                    On the other hand, an approach which is too relaxed may incentivise parties to
                    “take their chances” and not make an application under s 56A
                    first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On the whole, it is more likely that s 56A was
                    meant as an exclusive regime. However, it cannot be said that it is a
                    “very clear case” that this is so. Given that a “very clear
                    case” is a requirement for striking-out, the striking-out application
                    cannot be granted on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Having reviewed the law and the applicable
                    principles, this court is of the view that Tan undoubtedly had <em>locus standi</em> to raise a constitutional issue as he had
                    satisfied the “substantial interest” test in <em>Colin Chan</em>. It was also not clear on the state of the law as of
                    24 September 2010 that Tan must apply under s 56A of the SCA to bring his case
                    to court. What he failed to prove was that there was a real controversy in issue
                    as the charge had been withdrawn. Consequently, the Appeal is dismissed on this
                    ground with costs to the AG.</p>
