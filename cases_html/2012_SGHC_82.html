        Quentin Loh J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       At about 9.35 am on 12 December 2008, a motor
                    vehicle driven by the Appellant, Ms Ter Yin Wei (“Ms Ter”)
                    collided into another vehicle driven by the Respondent, Mdm Lim Leet Fang
                    (“Mdm Lim”). Mdm Lim was the plaintiff in the trial below and Ms
                    Ter was the defendant. Ms Ter did not dispute liability. Mdm Lim’s car was
                    damaged and, although she did not initially disclose that she had suffered any
                    personal injuries, she had visited a Polyclinic the day after the accident and
                    was diagnosed with whiplash and lumbar ligamental injuries 5 days
                later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       It is axiomatic that under liability policies,
                    as was the vehicle insurance policy in this case, there are insured and
                    uninsured losses. Insurance practitioners know that when settling or
                    compromising a case being pursued under subrogation or an assignment, they must
                    not compromise the insured’s right to claim for uninsured losses from the
                    tortfeasor when settling the insured losses. Otherwise they would be answerable
                    to the insured for their professional negligence. The same principle applies to
                    lawyers who receive instructions from motor workshops in motor accident
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This forms the sole issue on appeal, <em>viz</em>, did the hapless lawyer who was acting on
                    instructions from the motor workshop in settling the repair claim for the damage
                    to Mdm Lim’s car (including a loss of use claim) compromise Mdm
                    Lim’s right to claim for her personal injuries?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The learned District Judge (“DJ”)
                    decided that the settlement agreement reached between solicitors instructed by
                    Mdm Lim’s workshop and Ms Ter’s liability insurers (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> <em>infra</em>) did not prejudice Mdm Lim’s claims
                    for personal injuries. Ms Ter, or I should more correctly say her liability
                    insurers, appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After hearing both parties, I allowed the
                    appeal. I was asked by both counsel to issue a written judgment. As requested, I
                    now set out the reasons of my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relevant Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mdm Lim alleged that the pain, which indicated
                    she had suffered an injury, only began 3 hours after the incident. However, in
                    the Accident Report filed on the following day, 13 December 2008, in answer to
                    the question: “Was anybody injured in the Accident?” Mdm Lim
                    inexplicably wrote: “No”. Mdm Lim did not disclose that she was
                    suffering from pain although such pain had allegedly manifested itself the day
                    before. As noted above at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>, Mdm Lim
                    visited a Polyclinic directly after filing the Accident Report, and was
                    diagnosed with whiplash and lumbar ligamental injuries 5 days
                later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Following the usual practice, Mdm Lim sent her
                    car to the workshop and signed the usual papers which would have included a
                    fairly standard assignment. Again following the usual practice, her car would
                    have been repaired by the workshop and returned to her together with payment of
                    a sum of money for the loss of use of her car during the period of repair. I
                    pause to note that loss of use is an uninsured loss but the practice of the
                    workshops is to include this sum to encourage custom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The workshop instructed Messrs Teo Keng Siang
                    &amp; Partners (“TKSP”) to pursue the repair claim. TKSP sent a
                    letter of demand dated 5 February 2009 to Ms Ter’s insurers, HSBC
                    Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“HSBCI”) claiming for:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">This letter was copied to Ms Ter. Correspondence then ensued between
                    HSBCI and TKSP negotiating an acceptable settlement sum. On 18 February
                    2009, TKSP made an offer to settle at $4,491 after compromising on some items,
                    including reductions in (i) the cost of repairs to $3,300; (ii) loss of use to
                    $250 (5 days at $50 a day); and (iii) costs to $600. HSBCI gave a counter-offer
                    of a global sum of $4,200 all-in. Following this there was a telephone
                    conversation and a settlement was reached between TKSP and HSBCI on 25 February
                    2009 (“the Settlement”). TKSP wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We write to confirm settlement in a global sum of $4,300 (all–in) as
                        full and final settlement. Kindly let us have your discharge voucher and
                        cheque within 7 days from the date hereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       HSBCI sent its standard Discharge Voucher
                    (“DV”) to TKSP on 25 February 2009 and asked that it be signed and
                    returned, whereupon HSBCI would make payment. It should be noted that although
                    the DV had Mdm Lim and Ms Ter’s names printed out in the text, the bottom
                    had spaces above and next to the notations “Signature of Claimant”
                    with the “Name” and “NRIC/Passport No.” left blank
                    and to be filled in. TKSP returned the duly signed DV to HSBCI on 16 March
                    2009. There was a signature appended to the DV above the description
                    “Signature of Claimant” and Mdm Lim’s name and NRIC number
                    were written in the blank spaces below. The DV was in fact not signed by Mdm Lim
                    but by Ms Liew Sun Kiap (“Ms Liew”), a representative of
                    the workshop. There was no averment or dispute that Ms Liew did not have the
                    authority to compromise the claim<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The DV
                    stated, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We/I LIM LEET FANG hereby agree to accept the sum of S$4,300 ... <em>in full and final settlement of all claims we/I have or may
                            have against</em> [HSBCI] and/or their insured TER CHAI SENG ...
                        in respect of an accident involving SGH 3575M and SFF 4293S at/along BUKIT
                        TIMAH RD &amp; CASHEW RD which occurred on or about 12.12.2008 ... <em>Upon</em> our/my <em>receipt of such
                            payment [HSBCI] and their Insured shall be fully discharged from all
                            claims we/I have or may have in respect of the
                        incident.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... We/I also agree to indemnify [HSBCI] and their Insured against any
                        claim whatsoever made against them by any person on my behalf in respect of
                        the incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I/We further authorize you to pay the above settlement sum directly to
                        [TKSP].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The ambit and construction of the Settlement
                    embodied in the DV was disputed. HSBCI and Ms Ter claimed that the sum of $4,300
                    was accepted in full and final settlement of all claims Mdm Lim had or may have
                    had in respect of the accident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> HSBCI claimed at the trial below that
                    Mdm Lim’s cause of action for personal injury had merged with the
                    settlement agreement in the DV and the DV discharged HSBCI and Ms Ter from all
                    claims which Mdm Lim had or may have had. On the other hand, TKSP and Mdm Lim
                    contended that the agreement only referred to the workshop claim for damage to
                    the car and could not include a discharge from the personal injury
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The DJ ruled in favour of Mdm Lim. He placed
                    great weight on the initial letter of 5 February 2009 and correspondence leading
                    up to the Settlement, which only referred to the vehicular damage. He found that
                    the Settlement was reached on 25 February 2009 when TKSP accepted HSBCI’s
                    global counter-offer in respect of the property damage. There was no mention of
                    Mdm Lim’s personal injuries, and therefore, no basis to imply that the
                    parties’ settlement also included these personal injuries. In any case,
                    such an implied term did not lend any business efficacy to the settlement
                    agreement. The DV was something that came after the parties’ agreement on
                    25 February 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The learned DJ relied on the Court of Appeal
                    decision in <em>Projection Pte Ltd v The Tai Ping Insurance Co
                        Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 798 (“<em>Tai Ping
                        Insurance</em>”) as being very instructive and quoted <em>Tai Ping Insurance</em> at [21] for the proposition that a discharge voucher “was no
                    more than an acknowledgement of the receipt of the sum in full and final
                    settlement of the claim”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The DV therefore could not to be taken
                    into account in construing the compromise or agreement that was reached; rather,
                    the correspondence and intentions of the parties were decisive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The learned DJ also distinguished <em>Kitchen Design and Advice Ltd v Lea Valley Water Co</em>
                    (1989) 2 Ll.L.R. 221 (“<em>Kitchen
                        Design”)</em> as being appropriate where there is a settlement
                    in the course of litigation of a property damage claim and the omission of a
                    loss of profit claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                    The learned DJ felt that the judge in <em>Kitchen
                        Design</em> telescoped considerations belonging to <em>res judicata</em> to the issue of compromise when the proper
                    consideration of the compromise reached should have been by way of an objective
                    and contextual measure of the written and, where applicable, oral terms of the
                    compromise, citing <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v
                        B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                        (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”) SGCA 26 and
                        <em>Sandar Aung v Parkway Hospitals Singapore Pte Ltd
                        (trading as Mount Elizabeth Hospital) and another</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R)

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reasons for Allowing the Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     With respect, I could not agree with the
                    learned DJ’s reading of <em>Tai Ping Insurance</em>.
                    The issue being addressed in that case was totally different, <em>viz</em>, whether the parties had reached an agreement on settlement.
                    That case arose in the context of a building contract. A retaining wall had
                    collapsed during construction, causing damage to surrounding property. The main
                    contractor made a claim under his Contractor’s All Risk Policy. There were
                    protracted negotiations for settlement. Eventually, the insurer wrote to the
                    main contractor’s agents on 31 March 1999, referring to previous
                    correspondence and discussions, and agreeing, after adjustment, that “the
                    final figure payable is $553,560.98.” They enclosed a discharge voucher,
                    which the main contractor signed and returned but added the words “this
                    full and final settlement shall be limited to the aforesaid incident
                    only”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is important to note the arguments raised
                    by the insurer before the Court of Appeal in <em>Tai Ping
                        Insurance</em>. First, it disputed that a compromise agreement had in
                    fact been reached. Secondly, it argued that its letter of 31 March 1999 was an
                    offer, which was not accepted in accordance with its terms, given the addition
                    of the words penned by the main contractor. It argued, therefore, that there was
                    no concluded compromise agreement. Further, the insurer required the signatures
                    of both the main contractor and the owner of the project to the discharge
                    voucher to conclude an agreement. The Court of Appeal held that, on the facts, a
                    clear compromise agreement had been reached to indemnify the main contractor up
                    to $553,560.98 for the incident. The insurer’s letters of 9 December 1998
                    and 31 March 1999 were set out in full at [18] and [19] of the
                    Judgment in <em>Tai Ping Insurance</em>. Paragraph
                        [21] of <em>Tai Ping
                        Insurance</em> therefore had to be read in the context of the
                    insurer’s contentions, which included an argument that a properly signed
                    discharge voucher was a condition of the settlement. There was no issue on the
                    width and ambit of the words used in relation to a full and final settlement of
                    all claims the insured had or may have had. <em>Tai Ping
                        Insurance</em> was certainly not authority that a discharge voucher is
                    only an acknowledgement of the receipt of a sum of money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With respect, I also could not agree with the
                    DJ’s construction and understanding of the DV. The DV was not a receipt
                        <em>simpliciter</em>. On its face, it recorded payment
                    of a sum of money in respect of an accident, and it stated in clear and
                    unambiguous language that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     the payment was in <em>full and final settlement of all claims</em> that the
                        recipient <em>had</em> or <em>may have
                            </em><em>had</em> against HSBCI and/or their
                        insured, Ms Ter; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     upon payment, HSBCI and their insured, Ms Ter, <em>shall be fully discharged from all claims</em> the recipient
                            <em>has</em> or <em>may
                            have</em> in respect of the incident or
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no other construction of the DV other
                    than that, with the payment, it was a full and final settlement of, and full
                    discharge from <em>all</em> claims that the recipient
                        <em>had</em> or <em>may have
                        had</em> against the insurer and the insured driver. The word
                    “have” in the DV<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> referred to all claims that the
                    recipient possessed or had put forward at that time. The phrase “may
                    have” in the DV<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> clearly referred to claims that had not been
                    put forward at that time, or claims that might arise in the future. Such a
                    construction is reinforced by the second paragraph of the DV, which provided
                    that the recipient indemnified the insurer and the insured driver against any
                    claims that may be brought by any other person on the recipient’s behalf
                    in respect of this same accident or incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The practice of insurers recording a full and
                    final settlement and obtaining a full discharge and indemnity on the terms set
                    out in the first two paragraphs of the DV or on terms very similar to that has
                    been around for at least half a century. The practice of obtaining discharge
                    vouchers on the terms used and referred to above are of very long standing use
                    and is very familiar to those who practise in the industry. TKSP themselves
                    dealt with numerous DVs in their dealings with HSBCI, a fact which I shall
                    return to later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     This long standing use of certain words or
                    phrases in documents of this nature has also acquired a certain legitimacy over
                    the years as they have been endorsed by the courts. The following passage in
                    David Foskett, <em>The Law and Practice of Compromise</em>,
                        7<sup>th</sup> ed. (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2010) at [5-21] is
                    apt:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is important to emphasize also that reference to cases in which the
                        court has reached a particular conclusion in relation to a particular word
                        or phrase will be of limited assistance in other cases. In this area, in
                        particular, authorities ‘must be read in the context of their peculiar
                        facts’. That having been said, <em>certain phrases,
                            hallowed by long and frequent usage, are likely to receive substantially
                            the same response by way of construction in most compromises in which
                            they appear. An obvious example would be the well established formula
                            “in full and final settlement of all claims that [C] has or may
                            have arising from the accident.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Again, at [2-08]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Parties frequently seek to compromise
                        “potential” issues between them even if those issues have not
                        yet been elevated to the status of an actual dispute. A familiar and
                        well-established formula for settling disputes is in the following (or
                        similar) terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“A agrees to accept from B the sum of [figure] in full and
                            final settlement of all claims which he has or may have arising from
                            [the specified incident or other state of affairs.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The intention of wording of this nature is plain. It is intended that the
                        payment should discharge finally all claims that have not merely already
                        been advanced, but also those which might subsequently be advanced in
                        connection with whatever incident or state of affairs had brought the
                        parties into dispute. It follows that the intention of the agreement
                        underlying the use of this formula is that an issue not yet identified or
                        formulated is also to be regarded as comprehended in the settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     With respect, I could not agree with the
                    learned DJ’s reading of <em>Kitchen Design</em>
                    either. In that case, the plaintiff’s insurers made a subrogated claim for
                    property damage which was settled by a payment. The relevant phrases used in the
                    DV were very close to that used in <em>Kitchen
                    Design</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n full satisfaction, liquidation and discharge of all claims we have or
                        may have against Lea Valley Water Company in connection with a burst water
                        main in High Road, Finchley, London N. 12. on 1<sup>st</sup>
                        February 1984.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Subsequently, the plaintiff’s insurers brought another
                    subrogated claim arising from the same incident for loss of profits. Phillips J
                    disallowed the claim and held at 224 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The formula “all claims we have or may have” was clearly
                        designed to cover, not merely claims actually advanced in relation to the
                        burst main, but other claims not advanced which might be advanced. <em>The fact that the respective adjusters were only negotiating in
                            respect of specific items of physical damage cannot detract from the
                            natural meaning of the phrase</em>; nor can I see any
                        justification for restricting the phrase to claims in respect of which
                        Q.B.E. already enjoyed rights of subrogation as opposed to claims in respect
                        of which they might acquire rights of subrogation in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The issue of <em>res judicata</em> was never
                    raised in this case. The earlier claim was compromised out of court and without
                    any admission of liability. With respect, I could not understand how
                    Phillips J was said to have telescoped considerations belonging to
                        <em>res judicata</em> into the issue of compromise.
                    Again with respect, Phillips J construed the clear words of the settlement and
                    discharge voucher set out above; he did not and did not have to imply a term
                    into the settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I find that <em>Kitchen
                        Design</em> was directly on point. It had nothing to do with <em>res judicata</em> and was not reasoned on that basis, but on
                    the basis of an interpretation of the terms used when the first claim was
                    settled. The court took into account the context in <em>Kitchen
                        Design</em>, but found that it was not enough to displace the clear
                    meaning of the words in the discharge voucher. On the contrary, I found that
                        <em>Kitchen Design</em> directly supported my views set
                    out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     This same approach is found in <em>O’Boyle and another v Leiper and another</em>, The
                    Times Law Reports, January 26 1990. Through his negligence, a vendor’s
                    solicitor caused the completion of the sale of his client’s property to be
                    delayed by one year. The vendor L’s initial letter of claim to her
                    solicitors in November 1982, also requested an indemnity for any claim that the
                    purchasers of the property may bring against her due to the delay. Her solicitor
                    did not agree and thereafter only desultory correspondence and negotiations took
                    place until March 1984 when fresh negotiations re-started which only related to
                    her direct pecuniary loss. In June 1986 L sent a draft statement of claim to her
                    solicitors which only pleaded her claim to damages for strict pecuniary loss. In
                    August 1986, L accepted an offer from her solicitors for £20,000 paid
                    “in full and final settlement” of her claims “arising out
                    of this matter.” Unfortunately, in October 1987, just three weeks before
                    the expiry of the limitation period, the purchasers sued L and she issued a
                    contribution notice against the solicitor. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial
                    judge’s holding that the natural inference from the correspondence and the
                    draft statement of claim was that the compromise was intended to include all of
                    L’s claims against her solicitor. In comparison, the phrases used in the
                    DV before me were more all encompassing and comprehensive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I agree with the learned DJ’s comments
                    on <em>Brunsden v Humphrey</em> (1884) 14 QBD 141 at
                        <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> of his judgment. However I would
                    point out that <em>Dattani v Trio Supermarkets Ltd</em>
                    [1998] IRIR 240 (“<em>Dattani</em>”) must be
                    read with care. The appellant there brought a claim for unfair dismissal before
                    the industrial tribunal. It was only in giving details of his complaint that the
                    appellant alleged he had never been paid the level of wages which had been
                    agreed; he had raised the question of money owed to him on numerous occasions
                    and that he had been dismissed when he raised the matter yet again. Before the
                    end of the tribunal’s proceeding, the parties settled the matter. It is
                    important to note that the only relevant contemporaneous document related to the
                    compromise is a handwritten document addressed to the appellant; it read:
                    “In consideration of your accepting the sum of £5,000...<em>in settlement of your claim for unfair dismissal</em>”
                    [emphasis added]. The industrial tribunal recorded: “This case has been
                    settled on the basis that the respondent pay the applicant the sum of
                    £5,000”. The basis of the settlement was therefore limited in scope
                    and did not contain any of the words or phrases used in the DV before me nor was
                    there an accompanying indemnity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The fact that the correspondence between TKSP
                    and HSBCI only mentioned property damage and loss of use is insufficient to
                    displace the clear and unambiguous meaning of the words “all claims we/I
                    have or may have in respect of the incident” in the DV. The words of the
                    DV were clear and unambiguous. It was not legitimate on the facts of this case
                    to go into the context and then read into clear and unambiguous words something
                    contrary to what those words plainly mean. Nor was it permissible to imply a
                    term to the effect that the DV was without prejudice to Mdm Lim’s right to
                    claim for her personal injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There was no claim for rectification. In fact,
                    there could not have been any such claim. TKSP had dealt with HSBCI many a time
                    prior to this particular accident. The exchange of a discharge voucher was
                    routine, and Mr Teo Keng Siang (“Mr Teo”) of TKSP accepted it as
                    “market practice”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In TKSP’s letter dated 23 February 2009
                    to HSBCI, TKSP made an offer and stated: “Kindly let us have your
                    discharge voucher and cheque if you are agreeable”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It was TKSP who
                    asked for the DV. TKSP did so again in their letter dated 25 February 2009 to
                    HSBCI when they confirmed the settlement at $4,300 all-in.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     TKSP’s Mr Teo stated in
                    cross-examination that he dealt in a similar way with “all”
                    insurance companies in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> During the trial, HSBCI produced other
                    discharge vouchers processed and signed by TKSP’s other clients with
                    similar motor accident claims but who also had personal injury claims and on
                    these discharge vouchers TKSP had caused to be stamped: “Signed without
                    prejudice for any personal injury claim”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> or with “this indemnity is signed
                    without prejudice to my rights to claim for compensation for my personal
                        injury”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>
                    typed in. Mr Teo affirmed under cross-examination that this was indeed their
                    regular practice when dealing with such insurance claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Mr Teo also admitted under
                    cross-examination that he had handled other claims where there were no personal
                    injuries involved and he did not stamp the reservation on the discharge voucher
                    signed by his “clients”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> TKSP was therefore, on its own evidence, very
                    familiar with the practice of having their clients sign discharge vouchers. The
                    regularly-used terms of such discharge vouchers were also very familiar to TKSP.
                    If there was a personal injury claim to be made, they would reserve those rights
                    for their clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It was clear that TKSP had, very
                    unfortunately, slipped up in this case. Mr Teo was asked this very question and
                    gave a rather long and convoluted answer, in which he effectively admitted that
                    they would normally stamp their reservation of rights for the personal injury
                    claim if there were such injuries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> In this case, Mr Teo all but
                    admitted that he was aware of the existence of a possible personal injury claim
                    at the time the correspondence with HSBCI commenced. In admitting under
                    cross-examination that there was no mention of a personal injury claim in the
                    correspondence, he went on to clarify that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiff has another cause of action in personal injury and she has a
                        three year time limit to mount a claim for personal injury. Because she is
                        undergoing either physio [sic] or Chinese sinseh treatment in Johore Bahru,
                        we normally have to see whether there was a lapse of time before seeing
                        whether there is permanent disability. However, we have to clear the
                        workshop claim because of repair fast. That’s why pages 20 to 32 are
                        for property damage claim only. This is why we have no mention of personal
                        injury because we have no idea how long treatment will take. And we do not
                        want to delay the other cause of action, which is the workshop claim for
                        property damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If that was true, and TKSP had a practice of stamping a reservation on
                    the standard form DV, then unless there had been a slip up, I could not
                    understand why that reservation had not been made. The truth seemed to be this:
                    TKSP, in acting for and under the instructions of the motor workshop, and in
                    pushing for a speedy recovery for the repair costs already incurred by the motor
                    workshop, most unfortunately forgot to reserve Mdm Lim’s personal injury
                    claims, and thereby compromised her right to make such a claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Mdm Lim’s reliance on <em>Zurich Insurance</em> and arguments on the contextual approach are,
                    with respect, quite misplaced. I agree <em>Zurich
                        Insurance</em> ruled that ambiguity is not a pre-requisite for looking
                    at the context, however the Court of Appeal did not suggest that a party could
                    bring in contextual evidence without limitation. On the contrary, the Court of
                    Appeal was very careful to lay down quite a few restrictions and limitations,
                    especially given the provisions in the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 and 1997 Ed).
                    The Court of Appeal also said a first and foremost consideration was the essence
                    and attributes of the document being examined. This was repeated very recently
                    in <em>Master Marine AS v Labroy Offshore Ltd and
                        others</em> [2012] SGCA 27 at [34]. Where it is a standard form for
                    commercial circulation, as this DV undoubtedly was (and was used frequently by
                    TKSP and others in their dealings with insurers in Singapore), the courts would
                    usually be more restrained in their examination of the context as there is a
                    need for contractual certainty. The Court of Appeal was careful to say in
                        <em>Zurich Insurance</em> that extrinsic evidence must
                    be used to explain or illuminate the written words and not to contradict or vary
                    them. The words of the DV were clear and unambiguous and with a meaning that was
                    plain and fixed. The key phrases used there – ‘full and final
                    settlement’, ‘fully discharged’ and ‘claims I have/may
                    have’ – are in their internal and external context intrinsically
                    clear. Further, they have been construed consistently, upheld time and again and
                    have acquired a certain meaning in law. Through long usage and judicial
                    endorsement, there is no penumbra as the light is now sharply focussed in one
                    bright circle of light, and solicitors, acting on the instructions of other
                    parties, like insurers or assignees of limited rights, ignore the interests of
                    the true litigant or insured at their peril.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     “The law loves compromise” wrote
                    Lord Bingham LCJ in the foreword to the 4<sup>th</sup> Edition
                    (1996) of David Foskett, <em>The Law and Practice of
                        Compromise.</em> There are good public policy reasons for this. It
                    cuts down the number of trials and saves valuable court time. In the foreword to
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Edition (1980) of that same book, Lord Lane,
                    LCJ wrote: “If it were not that a high proportion of cases are
                    compromised long before they reach court, the administration of justice would
                    soon grind to a halt; the courts would be overwhelmed by the volume of
                    work.” For the parties, it avoids the expense of litigation, the
                    expenditure of non-productive time and the anxiety, risk and uncertainty
                    inherent in a trial. To encourage this process, the offer-to-settle procedure in
                    O 22A, Rules of Court (Cap.322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) was introduced some time ago
                    to complement existing machinery like payment into court and <em>Calderbank</em> letters. Today, in aid of the same aims, alternative
                    methods of dispute resolution are encouraged and supported. The overarching
                    principle is that litigation should be the last resort. The law therefore
                    encourages settlements and upholds compromises. As Mummery LJ stated in
                        <em>Dattani</em> at 241: “The law, in its
                    promotion of finality and certainty in dispute resolution, loathes litigation
                    about compromises.” However, as experience shows, disputes over
                    compromises do occur and in such cases the courts have to deal with it. But, on
                    the facts and circumstances here, this is, by far, not such a
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This is not a case of a lay person being
                    misled into signing something, see <em>eg</em>, <em>Saunders v Ford Motor Company Ltd</em> [1970] 1 LIL.R 379, or
                    signing something she did not understand or signing a document in a language she
                    was unfamiliar with. There was no claim for <em>non est
                        factum</em>. There was also no claim of a lack of authority by the
                    workshop’s Ms Liew to sign the DV. I accordingly was of the view that Mdm
                    Lim, by giving Ms Liew authority to sign the DV on her behalf, was bound by her
                    signature on the DV and by its plain and unambiguous terms. Any subjective
                    understanding that only the property damage claim was compromised “cannot
                    have been relevant and admissible evidence, in the absence of any plea of
                    mistake or rectification”; see <em>Capon v
                        Evans</em> (1986) CAT 413.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For the reasons given above, I allowed the
                    appeal and set aside the judgment below and the order for assessment of damages
                    for the personal injury. I also entered judgment for the
                Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I also set aside the order of costs below. My
                    understanding of [29] and [30] of the learned DJ’s Grounds of
                    Decision was that he had awarded costs to Mdm Lim but reserved quantum therefor
                    to the deputy registrar hearing the assessment. I order costs here and below to
                    the Appellant, who was the defendant at first instance, to be agreed, and if not
                    agreed, to be taxed.</p>
