<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision

On Assessment of Damages</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1.    The background of this action and assessment of damages is

set out in the Grounds of Decision (Grounds) of the Assistant Registrar Tan Wen Shan dated 19

October 2000.

</p><p align="justify">2.    This action arose from a mid-air incident on board flight SQ

420 from Singapore to Dhaka on 25 November 1994, as a result of which the plaintiff Tan Shwu Leng (Ms

Tan) was injured. Her main injury was a fracture of the left humerus as a result of which she was

grounded instead of undertaking cabin crew duty with its various benefits. At the material time, she

was employed by Singapore Airlines Limited (SIA), the owners of the aircraft, as a Leading

Stewardess (LSS). On 3 November 1997, Ms Tan commenced the present action against SIA for

damages for negligence and alternatively breach of statutory duty. Airbus Industrie, the

manufacturers of the aircraft, were subsequently joined as co-defendants. Interlocutory judgment was

entered against both Defendants on 19 September 1999 for damages to be assessed.

</p><p align="justify">3.    At the end of four and a half days of assessment, AR Tan

awarded Ms Tan $13,000 for pain and suffering, $77,491.60 for loss of pre-trial earnings, and

$225,534.21 for loss of future earnings.

</p><p align="justify">4.    The total amount payable to Ms Tan including interest

pursuant to AR Tans assessment was less than $350,000.

</p><p align="justify">5.    On 24 January 2000, an offer to settle Ms Tans claim at

$350,000 had been made by the Defendants (the Offer), but the Offer was not accepted.

</p><p align="justify">6.    In the circumstances, AR Tan ordered that:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    Ms Tan be entitled to costs on a standard basis up to the

  date of the Offer but AR Tan limited such costs to costs in respect of work done in the matter

  only,

  </p><p align="justify">(b)    The Defendants be entitled to costs on an indemnity basis

  from the date of the Offer onwards.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">7.    It was not clear what costs in respect of work in the

matter only meant.

</p><p align="justify">8.    Mr Lawrence Teh for SIA submitted that it was limited to

work done for liability only as that was his argument which AR Tan appeared to have accepted.

</p><p align="justify">9.    The appeal before me proceeded on the basis of this

interpretation.

</p><p align="justify">10.    After hearing arguments, I made the following order:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    For pain and suffering, no change.

  </p><p align="justify">(b)    For loss of pre-trial earnings, to add $2,736.31 and

  $14,700 back to the sum awarded by AR Tan with interest at 3% per annum from date of the accident

  to date of AR Tans decision.

  </p><p align="justify">(c)    For loss of future earnings, no change.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">11.    I would add that I also disallowed Ms Tans claim for

alleged medical expenses ($125) and alleged transport expenses ($1,652) as there was no documentary

evidence before AR Tan on these items. I disallowed an attempt by Mr V Ramakrishnan for Ms Tan to

adduce documentary evidence of the same at the appeal before me.

</p><p align="justify">12.    In the light of my order as set out in para 10 above, I was

informed that the total amount payable to Ms Tan would then be $352,279.33 including interest

(according to Defendants Joint Submission on Costs, para 10).

</p><p align="justify">13.    The quantum of damages and interest for the purpose of

assessing the Offer was $351,809.82 (according to Defendants Joint Submission on Costs, para 11).

</p><p align="justify">14.    In the circumstances, I rescinded the order of AR Tan on

costs and ordered that:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    The Defendants pay the costs of Ms Tan up to the date of

  the Offer and this would include getting up on quantum, in addition to liability.

  </p><p align="justify">(b)    Costs thereafter, up to the date of the decision of AR

  Tan, was fixed at $1,000 to be paid by the Defendants to Ms Tan.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">15.    As for costs of the appeal before me, I ordered that the

Defendants pay Ms Tan such costs fixed at $5,000.

</p><p align="justify">16.    The parties have appealed against different parts of my

main order as well as in respect of my order on costs.

</p><p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">MS TANS APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEAL</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">17.    I will deal with Ms Tans appeal first. It is against

that part of my order:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    in respect of pre-trial earnings,

  </p><p align="justify">(b)    in respect of loss of future earnings,

  </p><p align="justify">(c)    in respect of costs from the date of the Offer to the

  date of the decision by AR Tan.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">18.    In other words, Ms Tan has not appealed against my decision

in respect of pain and suffering or in respect of her claim for medical and transport expenses.

</p><p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">Loss of Pre-Trial Earnings</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">19.    As regards Ms Tans appeal to the Court of Appeal in

respect of pre-trial earnings, Ms Tan is claiming that the $91,302.12 deducted by AR Tan as work

expenses should be added back entirely or partially to her pre-trial earnings.

</p><p align="justify">20.    Ms Tan had been claiming various allowances which she would

have earned as a cabin crew but for the injury.

</p><p align="justify">21.    However AR Tan had decided that expenses which Ms Tan would

have incurred in earning the lost income had to be deducted relying on <i>Lim Poh Choo v Camden

&amp; Islington Area Health Authority</i> [1980] AC 174 at 191. Such expenses would be for, inter

alia, meals and transport while Ms Tan was not in Singapore, had she still been a cabin crew.

</p><p align="justify">22.    Before me, Mr Ramakrishnan argued that such a deduction

should not have been made.

</p><p align="justify">23.    As a matter of law, he relied on <i>Lim Poh Choos </i>case

(cited above) and <i>Dews v National Coal Board </i>[1988] 1 AC 1.

</p><p align="justify">24.    However, <i>Lim Poh Choos</i> case did not assist Mr

Ramakrishnan. It is authority for the principle that expenses incurred in earning income may be

deducted from damages to be awarded to avoid over-compensating a plaintiff. While expenses which Ms

Tan would have incurred are not literally spent to earn the income, they had to be deducted to

avoid over-compensating Ms Tan.

</p><p align="justify">25.    The case of <i>Dews</i> also did not assist Mr

Ramakrishnan. The passage he cited, at p 13 states:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">One is, however, left with the fact that wherever a man lives he is likely

  to incur some travelling expenses to work which will be saved during his period of incapacity, and

  they are strictly expenses necessarily incurred for the purpose of earning his living. It would,

  however, be intolerable in every personal injury action to have an inquiry into travelling

  expenses to determine that part necessarily attributable to a chosen life-style. I know of no case

  in which travelling expenses to work have been deducted from a weekly wage, and although the point

  does not fall for decision, I do not encourage any insurer or employer to seek to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">26.    However, the passage goes on to say:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">I can, however, envisage a case where travelling expenses loom as so large

  an element in the damage that further consideration of the question would be justified as, for

  example, in the case of a wealthy man who commuted daily by helicopter from the Channel Islands of

  London. I have only touched on the question of travelling expenses to show that in the field of

  damages for personal injury principles must sometimes yield to common sense, and to acknowledge

  the force of Mr. Alexanders submission that the calculation of loss in personal injury cases

  should be kept simple as a matter of policy, particularly where the sums involved do not justify

  the costs likely to be incurred by elaborate investigations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">27.    Therefore, usually the travelling expenses of a plaintiff

are too small to be inquired into.

</p><p align="justify">28.    However the situation before me was different. Ms Tan was

claiming allowances which she would have earned if she had not been injured but, at the same time,

she would have incurred various expenses if she had not been injured.

</p><p align="justify">29.    Mr Ramakrishnan also cited another passage from <i>Dews</i>

at p 14:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">In respect of this part of his earnings the object of which is to provide

  income available for current expenditure the tortfeasor is, subject to sums necessarily spent to

  earn the income, entitled to no credit for expenditure saved as a result of the injury; the

  principle that it is no concern of the tortfeasor how the plaintiff chooses to spend his income

  applies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">30.    In my view, this passage did not assist him and, on the

contrary, supported the Defendants position. It reflected the same principle as <i>Lim Poh Choos</i>

case.

</p><p align="justify">31.    Mr Ramakrishnan also cited the following passage from the

judgment of Selvam JC, as he then was, in <i>Balasubramaniam s/o Rajoo a minor suing by his father v

Singapore Airlines Limited and another</i> (apparently unreported) which said:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">Laundry and incentive allowance were given only for full attendance.

  However, there was no suggestion that the plaintiff was prone to absenteeism. Accordingly it

  should be included in the salary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">32.    It was clear from the passage cited that it was in respect

of different facts.

</p><p align="justify">33.    Furthermore, Ms Tan had conceded in her evidence that any

damages for loss of earnings should take into account expenses normally incurred whilst flying (see

NE of 31 July 2000 at p 6D).

</p><p align="justify">34.    On this point, evidence had been given by one Peter Chong,

Assistant Manager (Check/Training), Crew Performance Department, for SIA, that cabin crew spend

about 40% of their (entire) monthly allowances on such expenses.

</p><p align="justify">35.    The $91,302.12 deducted by AR Tan represents the 40%

deduction in the assessment of loss of pre-trial earnings.

</p><p align="justify">36.    Mr Ramakrishnan then argued that the 40% deduction should

not apply to the Inflight Allowance as it was more of an incentive allowance and not a reimbursement

for expenses to be incurred. He also pointed out that Mr Tehs Closing Submission at p 13 para 43

admitted that it should be excluded. Following this line of argument, he also argued that the 40%

deduction should not apply to Turnaround Allowance.

</p><p align="justify">37.    Mr Ramakrishnan also argued that a deduction of 40% was

excessive because:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    Crew meals are provided on most flights;

  </p><p align="justify">(b)    Options to have meals consumed outside crews hotel,

  eg. eateries in Chinatown, fast food outlets and take aways and etc would result in lower costs

  than dining via room-service or in-house restaurants and cafeteria and crews hotels during

  overseas layover;

  </p><p align="justify">(c)    Options for laundry done at home instead of sending to a

  launderette;

  </p><p align="justify">(d)    Option to travel by bus and MRT to get to and from the

  airport instead of relying on taxi for turnaround flights.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">38.    In addition, he also argued that Ms Tan would have incurred

transport and meal expenses while grounded which she need not have incurred while flying. The

suggestion was that there was some overlap if a deduction was already being made for similar type of

expenses she would have incurred overseas while flying.

</p><p align="justify">39.    Mr Teh argued that the 40% deduction should be deducted

from all allowances as that was Mr Chongs unchallenged evidence. Mr Chong had not said that a

distinction had to be made between on the one hand, allowances for transport, uniform and meal and

on the other hand, inlight allowance and any other allowance. Mr Teh also submitted that his Closing

Submission for SIA at p 13 para 43 had erred in so far as it had suggested that the 40% deduction

should not apply to the Inflight Allowance.

</p><p align="justify">40.    Mr Ashok Kumar for Airbus Industrie adopted Mr Tehs

arguments.

</p><p align="justify">41.    During arguments before me, Mr Ramakrishnan suggested that

he did challenge Mr Chong on his evidence about the 40% deduction. He referred to the second set of

notes of evidence at p 91 at C to D which states:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q: Overnight and meal allowances. Agree that some crew spend all of it and

  others do not?</p>
<p align="justify">A: No first-hand knowledge. It is certainly possible.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: And some crew would eat at cheaper restaurants and others at more expensive

  restaurants?</p>
<p align="justify">A: That is possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">42.    I was of the view that these questions did not amount to a

challenge to the figure of 40% from Mr Chongs evidence and the answers also did not contradict

the 40% figure.

</p><p align="justify">43.    In any event, Mr Ramakrishnan eventually accepted that he

had not challenged the 40% figure.

</p><p align="justify">44.    Ultimately, no other figure was suggested by Mr

Ramakrishnan to Mr Chong as the appropriate percentage to be deducted. Neither did Ms Tan in her

evidence suggest any such figure. However, in the appeal before me, Mr Ramakrishnan suggested a 10%

deduction instead of 40%. This submission came too late.

</p><p align="justify">45.    In the circumstances, I had to allow the 40% deduction,

amounting to $91,302.12, to remain in respect of the loss of pre-trial earnings. The 40% deduction

also applies to the loss of future earnings and AR Tan has taken this into account.

</p><p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">Loss of Future Earnings</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">46.    As for loss of future earnings, I would refer to paras 11

to 14 and 28 to 32 of AR Tans Grounds:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">11. As for loss of future earnings, which counsel for the Plaintiff labelled

  as "loss of future earning capacity" in his closing submissions, it was argued that the

  Plaintiff was entitled to a sum of $1,086,495.00 comprising the following elements.</p>

</table>
</div>
<p align="justify">12.    The multiplicand of $5,739.00 in item (i) was derived by

  calculating the average basic pay of a LSS, a CSS [Chief Stewardess] and an in-flight supervisor

  ("IFS"), which is the next rank in the cabin crew hierarchy after the post of CSS.

  Counsel for the Plaintiff explained that this approach had been taken to reflect the Plaintiffs

  chances of promotion in the future. Given the Plaintiffs excellent track record with the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants, counsel argued, but for the accident, she could and would have been promoted first to

  the post of CSS and then to IFS.

  </p><p align="justify">13.    In this respect, the Plaintiffs position was

  diametrically opposed to that taken by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants. Testifying on behalf of the

  1<sup>st</sup> Defendants, Mr Peter Chong stated that even if the Plaintiff had not been injured

  on 25 November 1994, she would probably still be at the rank of LSS currently and was likely to

  remain at that position for some time to come. He explained that this was because the Plaintiffs

  performance appraisal fell within the middle of the range of appraisal scores given to other FSSes

  who had been promoted to LSSes at around the same time as the Plaintiff. Furthermore, compared to

  those of her fellow LSSes who had been promoted to CSSes in 1995, the Plaintiffs performance

  appraisal score was ranked the 10<sup>th</sup> lowest. This indicated that the Plaintiff was not

  an outstanding candidate for promotion. Mr Chong also drew attention to the higher attrition rate

  in general amongst female cabin crew as compared to male cabin crew. In his view, the Plaintiff

  might have left the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants employment for, inter alia, personal reasons

  prior to being promoted to CSS even if she had not been injured. Mr Chong further pointed out that

  in any event, there had been a surplus of CSSes since 1998 in light of the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants decision to change the cabin crew composition for all types of aircraft apart from

  the Airbus A310. This change consisted of placing IFSes in charge of these aircraft in lieu of

  CSSes, thus reducing the need for CSSes within the organisation. According to Mr Chong, the

  combination of these factors made it unlikely that the Plaintiff would have been promoted to CSS.

  </p><p align="justify">14.    In his closing submissions, counsel for the Plaintiff

  contended that the above evidence of Mr Chong was unreliable for several reasons. First, Mr Chongs

  conclusion on the Plaintiffs promotion prospects, in terms of her performance appraisal score,

  was based only on her job performance. Other relevant factors such as the Plaintiffs

  educational qualifications, her years of work experience, and her good disciplinary and attendance

  record had not been taken into account, which Mr Chong conceded in cross-examination he ought to

  have done. Counsel pointed out that the difference between the Plaintiffs performance appraisal

  score of 18 and that of the successful candidates in the 1995 promotion exercise (score of 24) was

  only six points, which difference might have been bridged if these other factors had been

  considered. Second, it was argued that Mr Chongs omission to take relevant factors apart from

  job performance into account amounted to a deliberate suppression of evidence. Third, counsel

  submitted that Mr Chong had "deviously" introduced into his affidavit of

  evidence-in-chief figures and graphs which did not form part of the Agreed Bundle of Documents.

  This allegation appeared to be targeted at exhibit "PC-1A" of Mr Chongs affidavit,

  which is a table setting out the attrition rates for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants cabin crew

  from February 1999 to March 2000. The attrition figures had initially been set out in exhibit

  "PC-1", but a fresh table (exhibit PC-1A) was substituted in its place with the courts

  leave subsequently after Mr Chong alerted the parties of a calculation error which he had made in

  preparing exhibit PC-1.

  </p><p align="justify">.</p>
<p align="justify">28.    In terms of calculating the quantum to be awarded to the

  Plaintiff, I did not think that the approach canvassed by counsel for the Plaintiff ( 11, supra)

  would reflect accurately the loss in income which the Plaintiff is likely to suffer in future as a

  result of her injury. I was of the view, instead, that the award for loss of future earnings

  should be divided into two different time frames, namely (i) the period from the present date up

  to the end of her current contract with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants (5 October 2001); and (ii)

  the five-year period thereafter from 6 October 2001 to 5 October 2006.

  </p><p align="justify">29.    As I highlighted above ( 27, supra), the Plaintiff is

  still employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants presently. Notwithstanding her unfitness to

  perform cabin crew duties and the strain which this Suit must have had on her working relationship

  with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants, I thought it more likely than not that the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants would retain the Plaintiff in its employment till the end of her current contract,

  which expires on 5 October 2001. Since the Plaintiff would continue to receive her basic pay and

  CPF contributions for this period, her loss in income would be limited to the allowances which she

  would have earned had she been able to continue with her cabin crew duties. Taking a putative

  gross monthly salary of $5,185.00 ( 17, supra) and deducting the Plaintiffs basic pay and CPF

  contributions which come up to $1,889.20 per month ($1,718.37 + $171.83), the Plaintiff would be

  receiving $3,294.80 in allowances at present, if not for her injury. Of these allowances,

  approximately 40% would be spent on work-related expenses ( 20, supra). Thus, the Plaintiffs

  loss in income from the present date up to 5 October 2001 (rounding off this period of 12 months)

  would be $23,722.56 ([60% x $3,924.80] x 12 months).

  </p><p align="justify">30.    As for the period from 6 October 2001 onwards, I thought

  it unlikely that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants would renew the Plaintiffs contract for a

  further five-year term given her unfitness for cabin crew duties. If the Plaintiff had not been

  injured however, given her good service record, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants would most probably

  have extended her contract for a fourth five-year term. This would also have been her final

  contractual extension in light of cl 21(5)(d) of the 1998 Collective Agreement, which provided

  that a LSS should be employed on fixed term contracts consisting of four five-year contracts.

  Thus, even if the accident had not occurred, the Plaintiff would have had to leave the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants employment by 5 October 2006 at the very latest.

  </p><p align="justify">31.    In reaching the above conclusion, I discounted the

  possibility that the Plaintiff might have been promoted to CSS  with the corollary guarantee of

  alternative ground employment after the end of her fourth five-year contract if she so opted (cl

  21(7) of the 1998 Collective Agreement)  if she had not been injured. This was because her

  prospects of promotion were fraught with uncertainties. As Mr Peter Chongs evidence revealed,

  whether or not a cabin crew employee is promoted to a particular rank depends heavily on first,

  whether there are vacancies for that rank, and second, whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants

  decide to hold a promotion exercise. Mr Chong pointed out that it is not inevitable that a

  promotion exercise for a particular rank will be held if there is a shortage of cabin crew of that

  rank. For instance, a change in the business climate or the crew composition on flights might

  obviate the need for a promotion exercise for a particular rank even though there is or is likely

  to be a shortfall in cabin crew of that rank. In the case of CSSes, the first Defendants had

  decided not to elevate any of its employees to this rank with effect from 1998 due to the change

  in the cabin crew composition for its aircraft ( 13, supra). In light of this, I thought it

  unlikely that the Plaintiff would be made a CSS in the future. As for whether the Plaintiff would

  be a CSS by now if she had not been injured in November 1994, I thought this to likewise be

  unlikely. Mr Chong had indicated that the Plaintiffs performance vis--vis the other

  successful candidates in the 1995 exercise for promotion to the rank of CSS was not outstanding

  ( 13, supra). Admittedly, his conclusion was reached without the benefit of other relevant

  factors such as the Plaintiffs educational qualifications, work experience, and good

  disciplinary record. I did not, however, regard this omission as detracting from the weight to be

  placed on his evidence since a candidates job performance is the most important factor in the

  service record component of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants promotion process. Besides, even if

  the other factors had been taken into account, it is questionable if they would have improved the

  Plaintiffs performance appraisal vis--vis that of the other candidates significantly, since

  the Plaintiff was relatively junior in terms of her length of service with the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants, and since most of the other candidates were likely to have had education and

  disciplinary records comparable to hers. For these reasons, I did not think it likely that the

  Plaintiff would be either a CSS by now or promoted to that rank in future if she had not been

  injured. I thus assessed her loss of future earnings on the basis that she would continue to

  remain at her current position of LSS until 5 October 2006.

  </p><p align="justify">32.    I should add at this point that I found the submissions

  of counsel for the Plaintiff on Mr Chongs unreliability as a witness entirely devoid of merit.

  On the contrary, from the manner in which he gave evidence, I found Mr Chong to be a honest and

  truthful witness who did not shy away from admitting he had made mistakes in reaching the

  conclusion stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief when these errors were pointed out to him

  in cross-examination. There was also no question of his deliberately withholding evidence from the

  court or deviously introducing new evidence at the eleventh hour in the form of exhibit PC-1A of

  his affidavit. I allowed that exhibit to be substituted in lieu of exhibit PC-1 as I was satisfied

  that Mr Chong had made a genuine arithmetic error in working out the figures stated in the latter

  exhibit.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">47.    Ms Tan had suggested in her affidavit that the multiplier

should be 12 years. However during cross-examination, she said her lawyer would be in a better

position to deal with this point.

</p><p align="justify">48.    In closing submissions before AR Tan, Mr Ramakrishnan had

submitted that the multiplier should be 15 years based on a retirement age of up to 67 under the

Retirement Age Act. He referred to a number of authorities but mainly to two.

</p><p align="justify">49.    One of the cases he relied on was <i>Lai Wee Lian v

Singapore Bus Services (1978) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1984] 1 MLJ 325</nobr>.

</p><p align="justify">50.    However the facts there were different. In that case, the

plaintiff had sustained serious injuries when she was thrown off a bus, to the extent that her

mental powers had been greatly reduced and at most she could do simple work on a part-time basis.

The Privy Council in that case considered the plaintiffs age of 23 at the time of the accident

and the retirement age of 55 and then took into account the uncertainties of human life and the fact

that the plaintiff would be paid her damages as a lump sum. In these circumstances, the Privy

Council was of the view that a multiplier of 15 years was appropriate.

</p><p align="justify">51.    Another case cited by Mr Ramakrishnan was <i>Balasubramaniam

s/o Rajoo</i>, which was cited earlier for a different aspect of Ms Tans claim (see para 31

above). There, a multiplier of 16 years was used by the court. However this was also a case where

the mental powers of the plaintiff had been affected.

</p><p align="justify">52.    In Ms Tans case, there was no such suggestion. She can

carry on working up to age 55 or 60 or beyond. Even without the injury, she might or might not have

continued working with SIA as a cabin crew up to the expiry of the last of the five year terms

mentioned by AR Tan in her Grounds. It was much less likely that she would have continued working as

a cabin crew after the last of these terms.

</p><p align="justify">53.    In these circumstances, I was of the view that AR Tan was

correct in using a multiplier based on the expiry of the last of the five year terms and not based

on when Ms Tan would retire.

</p><p align="justify">54.    The next main argument by Mr Ramakrishnan on loss of future

earnings was that Ms Tan might have been promoted to the post of Chief Stewardess (CSS) and

then Inflight Supervisor (IFS). Ms Tan had made a claim based on the average pay of an LSS,

CSS and IFS. She said this was based on her having an equal chance of being promoted to CSS and then

to Inflight Supervisor.

</p><p align="justify">55.    On the other hand, Mr Chong did not think she would have

been promoted to CSS and then to IFS for the reasons mentioned by AR Tans Grounds.

</p><p align="justify">56.    Counsel for the Defendants also argued that there were so

many uncertainties in Ms Tans claim on this item (see the Grounds of AR Tan).

</p><p align="justify">57.    While it is true that there were many uncertainties in

respect of Ms Tans claim that she would have been promoted, the fact is that she has lost the

opportunity to be considered for promotion if a promotion exercise were to be conducted.

</p><p align="justify">58.    However, a claim for loss of opportunity would have to be

presented differently, ie. as a percentage of the pay of a CSS and an even smaller percentage of the

pay of an IFS to reflect the loss of opportunity.

</p><p align="justify">59.    Ms Tans claim was not presented on this basis and there

was no evidence as to what a fair percentage to represent the loss of opportunity should be.

</p><p align="justify">60.    Furthermore, Ms Tan is to be paid her damages in a lump

sum. This factor was not taken into account in determining the multiplier.

</p><p align="justify">61.    In the circumstances, I decided not to grant her any sum

for the loss of opportunity.

</p><p align="justify">62.    As regards Ms Tans appeal against my decision on costs,

I will deal with that later below together with the Defendants appeal against my decision on

costs.

</p><p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">THE DEFENDANTS APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEAL</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">63.    The Defendants appeal is against that part of my order:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    which adds $14,700 to the sum awarded by AR Tan for loss

  of pre-trial earnings,

  </p><p align="justify">(b)    in respect of my consequential order on costs.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">The $14,700</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">64.    The $14,700 was a sum deducted by AR Tan in respect of loss

of pre-trial earnings for Ms Tans failure to mitigate her damages.

</p><p align="justify">65.    I refer to paras 22 to 25 of AR Tans Grounds regarding

this:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">22. Fourth, I was of the view that a deduction had to be made from the

  Plaintiffs lost (<i>sic</i>) pre-trial income to reflect her failure to mitigate her loss

  arising from the accident.</p>
<p align="justify">23. During cross-examination, the Plaintiff stated that after the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants informed her in February 1997 that she was unfit to resume her cabin crew duties, she

  made some attempts to seek a cabin crew position with other airlines. She did not, however, pursue

  her inquiries beyond the preliminary stage as she thought it unlikely that other airlines would

  employ her given the condition of her hand and she "did not think [she] could bear the

  rejection if [she] were to go on". As for alternative non-cabin crew employment, the

  Plaintiff testified that she did not make any attempts to look for such jobs as the remuneration

  from these jobs was likely to be less than what she was receiving in 1997 as a grounded LSS. She

  subsequently conceded, however, that there might be some non-cabin crew positions which were more

  well-paid than her current post as a grounded LSS vis--vis her salary both in 1997 and at

  present.

  </p><p align="justify">24.    In light of the Plaintiffs evidence, counsel for both

  Defendants submitted that she had failed to mitigate the loss which she suffered pursuant to the

  Defendants wrong. It was argued that once she realised the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants would not

  re-deploy her on flights again, the Plaintiff could and should have taken reasonable steps to

  minimise her loss in income by seeking alternative employment either with other airlines or

  outside the airline industry. Counsel suggested that the Plaintiff could, for instance, have

  resumed a job in the banking industry where she previously worked before joining the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants, or pursued career opportunities in the hotel, advertising or service industry.

  </p><p align="justify">25.    I was of the view that the Plaintiff did not act

  unreasonably in not seeking alternative employment immediately after the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants

  informed her in February 1997 that she was unfit to work on board flights, given the uncertain

  economic climate then and the financial crisis which was soon to hit the Southeast Asian region.

  Even after economic conditions improved in late 1998/early 1999, the Plaintiff could not be

  faulted for failing to seek employment with other airlines as the residual weakness in her left

  hand made it highly unlikely that she would be able to secure any other cabin crew position. The

  Plaintiff should, however, have tried to look for an alternative <i>non-cabin crew</i> job

  [emphasis added] from that time onwards. Given the Plaintiffs good service record with the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants, attractive personality, and commendable grades in the Malaysian equivalent of the GCE

  "O" and "A" levesl, I was of the view that she could have obtained non-cabin

  crew employment, for instance as a secretary, which would have ameliorated the loss in allowances

  which she suffered after she was taken off cabin crew duties. To reflect this failure to mitigate

  her loss, a deduction of $700.00 per month for the period from January 1999 onwards  i.e. a

  total of $14,700.00 ($700.00 x 21 months)  ought to be made from the lost earnings to be

  awarded to the Plaintiff.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">66.    In cross-examination, it was put to Ms Tan that as regards

alternative non-cabin crew employment she did not make sufficient effort to reduce any loss which

she said she had suffered as a result of her injury. She agreed (NE of 31 July 2000 at p 7 at C).

</p><p align="justify">67.    In my view this was merely an agreement by Ms Tan that she

did not really try to seek alternative non-cabin crew employment. She did not concede that she had

acted unreasonably in failing to seek alternative non-cabin crew employment.

</p><p align="justify">68.    I was of the view that Ms Tan had not acted unreasonably in

failing to seek alternative employment in a different industry when she was still employed by SIA

and earning a decent salary.

</p><p align="justify">69.    Moreover, SIA might have had fringe benefits which other

industries might not have eg. their staff might only have to pay a small percentage for air fares on

its flights.

</p><p align="justify">70.    Secondly, while there might be some non-cabin crew

positions which were more well-paid than Ms Tans current position as a grounded LSS, there was

insufficient evidence to persuade me that she would have been likely to obtain alternative

employment at a higher salary.

</p><p align="justify">71.    Thirdly, the deduction of a sum of $700 per month (x 21

months = $14,700) to reflect the alleged failure to mitigate on Ms Tans part was without basis.

</p><p align="justify">72.    I should mention that during re-examination, Ms Tan had

made a concession. At NE 61 at B to D (of the notes of evidence on 31 July 2000 onwards), her

evidence was:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q: What would be the salary that you would draw as a clerk or receptionist?</p>
<p align="justify">A: In Singapore?</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">A: Not very well-versed with job market in Singapore. Probably $950 to $1,000

  per month.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Would you agree to deduction of this amount from the future earnings

  allowances by the Court:</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">73.    This concession was made in respect of future earnings and

not pre-trial earnings and applied by AR Tan to the former only. Furthermore it was made in the

context that some time in the future she might leave SIA and obtain alternative employment.

</p><p align="justify">74.    Even then I was puzzled as to why the concession was made

because Ms Tan did not say that the $950 or $1,000 per month was additional income over and above

her basic salary as a grounded LSS. However, as the concession was not withdrawn, I need not say any

more thereon except that her concession is not to be considered in the context of pre-trial

earnings.

</p><p align="justify">75.    In the circumstances, I decided that the $14,700 deduction

should not have been made and added this sum back to the amount to be awarded to Ms Tan for loss of

pre-trial earnings.

</p><p align="justify">76.    I had also added back $2,736.31 being excessive income tax

deducted by AR Tan in her computation of loss of pre-trial earnings (see para 10(b) above). However,

there is no appeal by the Defendants or Ms Tan in respect of the $2,736.31.

</p><p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">Costs</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">77.    The Defendants were not so much concerned with the $14,700

added back as the effect it would have on the issue of costs. With the $14,700 added back, the total

amount payable to Ms Tan turned out to be slightly more than the Offer (see paras 12 and 13 above).

This put the Defendants claim for indemnity costs (from the date of the Offer) in jeopardy.

</p><p align="justify">78.    However, both the Defendants Counsel still argued before

me that Ms Tan should be ordered to pay their costs on an indemnity basis under O 22A r 9(3) of the

Rules of Court.

</p><p align="justify">79.    Order 22A r 9(3) states:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(3) Where an offer to settle made by a defendant </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    is not withdrawn and has not expired before the

    disposal of the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and

    </p><p align="justify">(b)    is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff

    obtains judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,

  </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer

  was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless

  the Court orders otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">80.    They argued that, in substance, Ms Tan had not got more

than what had been offered and accordingly she should have to pay the costs of both Defendants on an

indemnity basis from the date of the Offer.

</p><p align="justify">81.    On the other hand, Mr Ramakrishnan argued that a sum of

$162,920.18 which Ms Tan had been receiving based on her current job should be also taken into

account in determining costs. He said that with this figure, Ms Tan would be receiving about

$460,000 (without even taking into account the sums which I had added back) and this was well in

excess of the Offer.

</p><p align="justify">82.    I did not agree. The $162,920.18 was not part of Ms Tans

claim as she was receiving it anyway. She was claiming more and the question before me was how much

more she should receive.

</p><p align="justify">83.    Mr Ramakrishnans other argument was that with the two

sums which I had added back, the total figure to be paid to Ms Tan was still more than $350,000. It

did not matter that it was slightly more. So long as it was not less favourable than the Offer, the

Defendants were not entitled to rely on O 22A r 9(3) to claim indemnity costs.

</p><p align="justify">84.    Furthermore, he argued that I should make the usual order

on costs following the event ie. that the Defendants continue to pay Ms Tan the costs from the date

of the Offer on a standard basis.

</p><p align="justify">85.    The Defendants relied on <i>The Birmingham and District

Land Company Limited v The London and North-Western Railway Company</i> [1887] 57 L.T. (the <i>Birmingham</i>

case) and <i>Roache v News Group Newspapers Ltd</i> [1992] Times Law Reports 23 Nov.1992.

</p><p align="justify">86.    As regards the <i>Birmingham</i> case, the Defendants

referred to p 187 of the report where Kekewich J said:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">That leaves me the only question about costs. The rule which I have always

  adopted, and intend to adopt until corrected by a higher authority, is, that an offer made after

  litigation commenced must, if it is to have any effect to avoid costs by an unsuccessful party,

  amount in substance to an offer of everything which the court eventually hold the successful party

  entitled to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">87.    However, this was a general statement referring to the

avoidance of having to pay costs. It did not deal with a rule which allowed the court not only to

let the offeror avoid paying costs but to order the offeree to pay costs and that on an indemnity

basis.

</p><p align="justify">88.    As for the <i>Roache </i>case, the Defendants referred to

the principle summarised in the Times ie:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">Where a plaintiff in a libel action was awarded the same sum as the

  defendants had paid into court before the trial, and had obtained an injunction against

  re-publication, for the purposes of costs it was the defendants who were in substance the

  successful parties since the claim for injunctive relief had not been a significant factor in the

  plaintiffs prosecution of his claim.</p>
<p align="justify">Accordingly, the plaintiff would be ordered to pay the defendants costs

  after the date of their payment into court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">89.    The Defendants also referred to the following passage in

the Times report:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">The judge had to look closely at the facts of the particular case before him

  and ask: Who, as a matter of substance and reality, had won? Had the plaintiff won anything of

  value or anything he could not have won without fighting the action through to a finish? Had the

  defendant substantially denied the plaintiff the prize which the plaintiff fought the action to

  win?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">90.    On the other hand, Mr Ramakrishnan referred to the

following two passages, in the Times report:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">The second principle was that where a plaintiff claimed a financial remedy

  in debt or damages and the defendant paid into court a sum not accepted by the plaintiff which was

  equal to or greater than the sum recovered by the plaintiff in the action the plaintiff ordinarily

  was ordered to pay the defendants costs from the date of the payment in.</p>
<p align="justify">In the ordinary way the plaintiffs failure in the present case to recover

  more than the sum paid into court would have led to an order that he pay the defendants costs

  from the date of payment in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">91.    He reinforced his argument by pointing out the Defendants

had not offered a sum equal to or greater than what Ms Tan had recovered.

</p><p align="justify">92.    I was of the view that the facts in the <i>Roache</i> case

were different from those before me. There, the plaintiff had obtained the same sum as the

defendants had paid into court and the question was whether the injunction he had also obtained was

sufficient to make him the successful party for the purpose of costs. The Court of Appeal decided in

the negative.

</p><p align="justify">93.    I was also of the view that the Defendants argument on

the application of O 22A r 9(3) was without merit.

</p><p align="justify">94.    First, if it was open to the Defendants to argue that they

could still rely on O 22 r 9(3) notwithstanding that Ms Tan was awarded slightly more, then it would

have been equally open to Ms Tan to argue that O 22 r 9(3) should not apply if she had been awarded

slightly less than $350,000. This would not be correct.

</p><p align="justify">95.    Secondly, the Defendants were effectively asking the court

to ignore the excess awarded, for the purpose of O 22 r 9(3), on the basis that it was only slightly

more. I was of the view that to do so would open the Pandoras box. For example, how much of the

excess should be ignored, $1,000 or $10,000 or should it be in percentage terms like 1% or 2% of the

Offer?

</p><p align="justify">96.    Thirdly, bearing in mind the severe consequences of O 22A r

9(3), I was of the view that it was incumbent on the Defendants to ensure that the Offer comes

within the scope of the rule. The Offer must be more favourable ie. more in terms of dollar value

than what has been awarded before the Defendants can rely on O 22A r 9(3).

</p><p align="justify">97.    I was of the view that this was the correct conclusion

because there is another rule on costs ie. O 22A r 12 which allows me to still take into account the

Offer even though the Offer is for a sum less than that eventually awarded.

</p><p align="justify">98.    Order 22A r 12 states:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">Discretion of Court (O.22A, r.12).</p>
<p align="justify">12. Without prejudice to Rules 9 and 10, the Court, in exercising its

  discretion with respect to costs, may take into account any offer to settle, the date the offer

  was made, the terms of the offer and the extent to which the plaintiffs judgment is more

  favourable than the terms of the offer to settle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">99.    In other words, it did not follow that just because the

Offer had failed to come within O 22A r 9(3), Ms Tan was entitled to be awarded costs on a standard

basis.

</p><p align="justify">100.    I took into account:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    the date of the Offer and its terms,

  </p><p align="justify">(b)    the fact that the sum awarded to Ms Tan under my decision

  was, as at the date of the Offer, around $2,000 more whereas she had claimed a total of about $1.1

  million in her affidavit ie. about $750,000 more.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">101.    The amount awarded to Ms Tan did not justify four and a

half days of assessment before AR Tan. On the other hand, she did receive more than the Offer.

</p><p align="justify">102.    In the circumstances, I awarded Ms Tan $1,000 as fixed

costs from the date of the Offer to the date of AR Tans decision. It is this aspect of my order

on costs for which Ms Tan is appealing to the Court of Appeal.

</p><p align="justify">103.    As for the costs before the date of the Offer, I saw no

reason why it should be confined to costs on liability only. If, as at the date of the Offer, no

work had yet been done by Ms Tans solicitors on the issue of quantum, then, she would not be

entitled to claim such costs. However, I was of the view that it was wrong to make a pre-emptive

order which would have denied her solicitors the opportunity of trying to establish that they had

done work on the issue of quantum as at that date.

</p><p align="justify">104.    Accordingly, I awarded Ms Tan costs prior to the date of

the Offer on a standard basis, such costs to include getting up on quantum in addition to liability.

</p><p align="justify">105.    As for costs of the appeal before me, Ms Tan had succeeded

only partially and had lost on the major items. However the partial success was sufficient to turn

around AR Tans order on costs from the date of the Offer such that Ms Tan no longer had to pay

the Defendants costs on an indemnity basis from the date of the Offer. That would have been quite

substantial.

</p><p align="justify">106.    In the circumstances, I decided that Ms Tan should be

entitled to some costs for the appeal before me but fixed it at $5,000.
