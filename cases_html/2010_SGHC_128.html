<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       By this Originating Summons No. 667 of 2009
                    (“OS 667”), the plaintiff, Bidvest Australia Ltd
                    (“Bidvest”) sought, <em>inter alia</em>, a
                    declaration that the first defendant, Deacons Singapore Ltd
                    (“D1”), had wrongly paid out to Vestey Foods Group Limited
                    (“Vestey”) a sum of US$4,221,641.68 (the “Escrow Sum"),
                    which D1 as stakeholder (“Escrow Agent”) had held in escrow
                    pursuant to an Escrow Letter dated 30 April 2007 (the “Escrow
                    Agreement”) signed by Bidvest, D1, and Vestey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 27 July 2009, Vestey was joined as a
                    second defendant in OS 667. Thereafter, in an affidavit filed on
                    23 September 2009, Mr Phillip Crowley, who is the managing partner of
                    D1, raised a counterclaim against Bidvest in OS 667 claiming that, in the event
                    that D1 was adjudged liable by this court for the release of the Escrow Sum, by
                    virtue of the Escrow Agreement, D1 would be exempted from liability towards
                    Bidvest; alternatively, D1 would be entitled to an indemnity against Bidvest and
                    Vestey pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In brief, the nub of the dispute was a legal
                    opinion issued by a law firm in the People of Republic China
                    (“PRC”) (the “Chinese legal opinion”) which D1
                    received and relied upon as the basis for the release of the Escrow Sum to
                    Vestey. The first issue before this court was whether, on a proper construction
                    of the Escrow Agreement, D1 was obliged to release the Escrow Sum to Vestey upon
                    receipt of the Chinese legal opinion; and in the event D1 was adjudged to be in
                    breach, the second issue was whether D1 could rely on the Escrow Agreement to
                    exclude liability or to seek an indemnity from Bidvest and Vestey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I agreed with Mr Hri Kumar SC representing
                    D1 that on the proper construction of the Escrow Agreement, D1 was obliged to
                    release the Escrow Sum to Vestey upon receipt of the Chinese legal opinion. In
                    reaching that conclusion, it was therefore unnecessary to consider D1’s
                    counterclaim. Accordingly, OS 667 was dismissed with costs. In dismissing OS
                    667, I informed the parties that I was not making any ruling on whether Vestey
                    had complied with its obligations in accordance with the contract underlying the
                    Escrow Agreement, namely the Sale and Purchase Agreement between Bidvest and
                    Vestey dated 30 April 2007 (“the SPA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Bidvest has since appealed against my decision,
                    and I now publish my reasons for dismissing OS 667.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">
<em>The SPA and the Escrow
                Agreement</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Bidvest is an Australian corporation and part of
                    a group of companies that specialise in the supply and distribution of food in
                    Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Asia. Vestey is a company incorporated
                    in England.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 30 April 2007, Bidvest and Vestey (which
                    was then known as Angliss International Limited) entered into the SPA whereby
                    Bidvest, for the price of US$80m, agreed to purchase the shares and assets of
                    several companies owned by Vestey, which included 80% of the total registered
                    capital of Guangzhou Angliss Jin Pan Refrigerated Co Ltd (“Jin
                    Pan”), a company incorporated in the PRC. D1 was the solicitor acting for
                    Vestey in the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 30 April 2007 and pursuant to cl 3.2 of
                    the SPA (“SPA/3.2”), Bidvest, D1, and Vestey entered into the
                    Escrow Agreement in the form of a letter addressed to D1. Under this Escrow
                    Agreement, D1 was appointed the Escrow Agent to hold the total sum of US$7m (the
                    “Escrow Funds”) in a bank account on behalf of Bidvest and Vestey.
                    The relevant section of SPA/3.2 is reproduced here with the sections relevant to
                    OS 667 emphasised in bold. SPA/3.2 refers to cl 7.3 of the SPA
                    (“SPA/7.3”), which in turn refers to cl 3.2A of the SPA
                    (“SPA/3.2A”), both of which are also be set out below:</p>

                    within 24 months of the Completion Date and that D1 was obliged to return any
                    unpaid portion of the Escrow Funds to Bidvest at the expiry of 24 months
                    from the Completion Date. The Completion Date was defined as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It was not disputed that the escrow mechanism
                    embodied in SPA/7.3(a) and the corresponding EA/5(a) arose out of
                    Bidvest’s concerns regarding the legal status of Jin Pan, one of the
                    companies which Bidvest wanted to acquire an interest in (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Jin Pan was incorporated as a Chinese joint
                    venture company with 80% of its shares being held by Vestey and the remaining
                    20% of its shares held by a PRC company known as Guangzhou Hai Zhu District Jin
                    Pan Cold Storage (the “Chinese JV Partner”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     By the time a due diligence report was issued
                    in April 2007 by Bidvest’s solicitors, Baker &amp; McKenzie
                    (“B&amp;M”), it became clear that the Chinese JV Partner had
                    already been de-registered in 1999, and it was uncertain as to which PRC
                    individual or entity had been designated the lawful successor to the Chinese JV
                    Partner. As the articles of association of Jin Pan required unanimous approval
                    of the board of directors for the assignment of assets or shares, both Bidvest
                    and Vestey were concerned as to the legal ability of the Chinese JV
                    Partner’s nominees on the board of directors to vote or consent to any
                    transfer of Jin Pan’s assets to Bidvest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In order to complete the sale and purchase
                    transaction as well as to alleviate Bidvest’s concerns regarding the
                    transfer of Jin Pan’s shares or assets, the escrow mechanism in SPA/7.3(a)
                    was then put in place to give Vestey a period of 24 months to regularise the
                    situation regarding Jin Pan.</p>

<em>Events leading up to the release of Escrow Sum and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Three days before the Deadline, on 5 May
                    2009, Bidvest received by fax a letter from D1 notifying Bidvest that D1 had
                    received a legal opinion (the “Chinese legal opinion”) according
                    to the terms set forth in cl 5(a)(iii) of the Escrow Agreement
                    (“EA/5(a)(iii)”) (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above) and consequently, D1 released the Escrow Sum to Vestey. The Escrow Sum
                    comprised of US$4m plus accrued interest less bank charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The following day on 6 May 2009, B&amp;M
                    faxed a letter to D1 stating that it had been instructed that Bidvest had not
                    received any transfer of Jin Pan’s shares or assets in accordance with
                    SPA/7.3(a). In the same letter, B&amp;M also requested D1 to furnish a copy of
                    the Chinese legal opinion and all the documents relating to the purported
                    transfer that justified D1’s release of the Escrow Sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     D1’s letter in reply of 7 May 2009
                    enclosed a copy of the Chinese legal opinion. The letter of 7 May 2009 was
                    written by D1 in its capacity as the Escrow Agent. It was common ground that, at
                    all material times, D1 was acting as Vestey’s solicitor in the SPA. In
                    that letter, D1 stated that it did not have any documents relating to the
                    transfer and that Bidvest would have to contact Vestey for the documents. D1
                    made known that its obligation under the Escrow Agreement was simply to release
                    part of the Escrow Funds upon receipt of the Chinese legal opinion. The Chinese
                    legal opinion was issued by a PRC law firm known as Guangda Law Firm
                    (“the Chinese law firm”) on 4 May 2009 and the material parts are
                    reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You have asked for our legal opinion in connection with <b><em>certain assets transferred by [Jin Pan] to Ms. YANG Chao

                    that the Chinese legal opinion reflected a transfer of Jin Pan’s assets to

                    B&amp;M wrote to D1 on 11 May 2009 (three days after the Deadline) seeking
                    clarification on how the Chinese legal opinion justified the release of the
                    Escrow Sum. As the Deadline had already passed by then, B&amp;M also requested
                    D1 to return the Escrow Sum to Bidvest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     D1 wrote two letters to B&amp;M on 14 May
                    2009. One letter was written by D1 in its capacity as Escrow Agent in which D1
                    reiterated that it was legally obliged pursuant to EA/5(a)(iii) to release the
                    Escrow Sum upon receipt of the legal opinion from the Chinese law firm. D1 wrote
                    the second letter in its capacity as Vestey’s solicitor and in that
                    letter, D1 stated that Bidvest had complied with its obligations under SPA/7.3
                    “by making available to [Bidvest] not less than 80% of the Jin Pan
                    assets, and this was achieved within the [two] year period agreed.” In
                    the same letter, D1 explained that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In accordance with the underling [sic] intention of [SPA/7.3(a)], [Vestey]
                        has found an alternative method of transferring to your clients not less
                        than 80% of the underlying assets of Jin Pan. <b><em>We are

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">This acquisition may be achieved either through a PRC company owned or

                            a new subsidiary to acquire the assets. We would suggest the former as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The legal opinion to which you refer in your letter does not satisfy the

                    by Vestey of its obligations under the SPA and countered that it was Bidvest who
                    appeared to be in breach for refusing to comply with its obligations under
                    SPA/7.3 and 7.5. In the second letter, D1 as Escrow Agent denied breaching the

                    Bidvest to finalise the transfer of Jin Pan’s assets. In that letter, D1
                    stated that Bidvest would be treated as being in breach of the SPA if Bidvest

                    (“Mr Copland”), a director of Vestey, deposed that the
                    Chinese legal opinion was obtained as part of the fulfilment of its obligations
                    under the SPA to use reasonable endeavours to transfer its equity interest in or
                    80% of the underlying assets of Jin Pan to Bidvest or its nominee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I begin at the point in time after the
                    Completion Date when Vestey’s entire shareholding in a company, Angliss
                    Hong Kong, was acquired by Bidvest. Thereafter, Bidvest had been managing Jin
                    Pan to date through Angliss Hong Kong. Therefore, although Vestey continued to
                    retain legal title to its equity interest in Jin Pan after completion, Bidvest
                    had assumed effective control over Jin Pan’s management and day-to-day
                        operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> According to
                    Mr Copland, one Mr Anthony Fok (“Mr Fok”) was
                    appointed as director of Angliss Hong Kong by Bidvest to oversee and manage Jin
                    Pan’s operations, and he was assisted by one Ms Cindy Ou Piao
                    (“Ms Ou”) who was the nominee director of the Chinese JV
                    Partner and employee of Jin Pan since 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mr Bernard Benson
                    (“Mr Benson”), the Chief Executive Officer of Bidvest, in his
                    affidavit dated 30 June 2009 took a contrary position. He maintained that
                    the senior management of Bidvest did not attempt to interfere or influence the
                    day-to-day operations of Jin Pan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> so as to facilitate a neat and orderly
                    withdrawal from the management and operations of Jin Pan in the event that
                    ownership of Jin Pan or its assets could not be successfully transferred to
                    Bidvest by the Deadline.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Sometime in June or July 2007, a dispute arose
                    between Mr Fok or Ms Ou and the PRC solicitors, Wang Jing &amp; Co
                    (“Wang Jing”), who had been appointed by Vestey to explore ways to
                    achieve a transfer pursuant to its obligations under the SPA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The dispute was over Wang Jing’s
                    fees which Mr Fok and/or Ms Ou objected to and that, in turn, led to
                    Wang Jing suspending work on the matter. After Vestey found out about this
                    dispute, Vestey settled Wang Jing’s fees on or around 31 January
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     According to Mr Copland, Wang Jing had
                    earlier identified a few alternative methods of procuring a transfer. One method
                    was to obtain a court-approved sale of the minority shares of Jin
                        Pan,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> a process which required a
                    court-appointed assessment firm to first assess the value of the minority shares
                    in Jin Pan. Wang Jing contacted Ms Ou on 23 April 2008 to request for
                    Jin Pan’s balance sheets and income statements for 2007 and the first
                    quarter of 2008 so that the assessment could be done.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> As the assessment firm was given only
                    up till the middle of May 2008 to complete its assessment, Mr Copland
                    personally got involved in the urgent process of obtaining the required
                    documents from Mr Fok and Bidvest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     After repeated requests, the documents were
                    provided to Mr Copland on 10 June 2008 and forwarded to Wang Jing on
                    12 June 2008. However, this proved too late because the court-appointed
                    assessment firm had ceased its cooperation and a new assessment firm had to be
                    appointed by the court. While waiting for the new appointment, Vestey and Wang
                    Jing also tried other ways to procure a transfer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     By the time a new assessment firm had been
                    appointed, on or around 3 December 2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Mr Copland realised that it might be
                    difficult for any transfer pursuant to a court-approved sale to be completed
                    before the Deadline. On 24 February 2009, Mr Copland wrote to
                    Mr Benson of Bidvest to request an extension of the Deadline.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> That request was rejected by
                    Bidvest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It was in those circumstances, that Vestey was
                    advised by its solicitors in the PRC that the transfer of 80% of Jin Pan’s
                    underlying assets to a local PRC entity would not require regulatory approval
                    and could be achieved without obtaining consent of the owner of the minority
                        shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It was with this
                    advice in mind that Vestey proceeded to take steps to incorporate a PRC company
                    called Guangzhou City Yangying Trading Co Ltd (“Yangying”) which
                    would first acquire 80% of the underlying assets of Jin Pan. After that, Vestey
                    would transfer 100% of the shares of Yangying or transfer onward the 80% of the
                    underlying assets to Bidvest or its nominee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As Yangying was in the process of being
                    incorporated, and with the Deadline fast approaching, 80.1% of Jin Pan’s
                    underlying assets were first transferred to Yangying’s two shareholders,
                    Ms Yang and Mr Zhao, on 4 May 2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and upon that transfer the Chinese law
                    firm issued the Chinese legal opinion (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the meantime, both Ms Yang and
                    Mr Zhao had earlier pre-signed a number of documents that would allow for
                    the transfer of Yangying’s shares or its assets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Yangying was incorporated on
                    19 May 2009 with Ms Yang and Mr Zhao as its shareholders.
                    Vestey’s solicitors in the PRC had advised that had the documents
                    pre-signed by Ms Yang and Mr Zhao been completed and executed by
                    Bidvest, the relevant assets or Yangying’s shares would have been
                    transferred to Bidvest or its nominee without any additional involvement on
                    Vestey’s part.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues raised by Bidvest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In written submissions, counsel for Bidvest,
                    Mr Lee Kiat Seng (“Mr Lee”), submitted that the Chinese
                    legal opinion did not satisfy EA/5(a)(iii) because it did not state or show a
                    transfer of assets to Bidvest or its nominees. Mr Lee raised three
                    arguments in advancing Bidvest’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     First, the terms of the SPA (in so far as they
                    were adopted in the Escrow Agreement) were incorporated in the Escrow Agreement
                    by reference. Mr Lee did not rely substantially on this argument (the
                    “incorporation issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Mr Lee’s second argument related to
                    the construction of the Escrow Agreement (the “construction
                    issue”). Mr Lee argued that reading the Escrow Agreement together
                    with the underlying SPA, the commercial purpose of the Escrow Agreement was to
                    provide “security for Bidvest” and therefore the correct
                    interpretation of EA/5(a)(iii) was that it required the Chinese legal opinion to
                    evidence a transfer of Jin Pan’s shares or assets <em>to
                        Bidvest or its nominees</em> and not to any other unrelated person. In
                    other words, Bidvest’s case was that EA/5(a)(iii) must be given a reading
                    that was identical to that of SPA/7(a)(iii) and that it did not make commercial
                    sense that the escrow arrangement would allow for a transfer of Jin Pan’s
                    assets to parties who were unrelated to Bidvest. Mr Lee submitted that D1
                    as Vestey’s solicitor was involved in the drafting of both the Escrow
                    Agreement and the SPA, and was therefore well aware of the commercial purpose of
                    both the agreements. As such, EA/5(a)(iii) required a transfer of Jin
                    Pan’s shares or assets to Bidvest or its nominees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In his alternative argument, Mr Lee
                    submitted that there ought to be an implied term that the condition in
                    EA/5(a)(iii) could only be satisfied if there was a transfer to Bidvest or its
                    nominees (the “implied term issue”). In making this argument, the
                    same grounds that were relied upon in his arguments on the construction issue
                    were used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I now address in turn each of the issues
                    raised by Bidvest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: The incorporation issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Citing the High Court decision of <em>ABB Holdings Pte Ltd v Sher Hock Guan Charles</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 111, Mr Lee submitted that cl 2 of the
                    Escrow Agreement (“EA/2”) would somehow entitle this court to look
                    at the SPA by incorporation when deciding how to interpret the Escrow Agreement.
                    EA/2 reads in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Capitalised terms used in this Letter shall bear
                            the meaning ascribed to these terms in the SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In my judgment, a simple reference to common
                    definitions without more would not result in an incorporation of any particular
                    express term of the SPA into the Escrow Agreement. Furthermore, Mr Lee did
                    not mention the precise terms of the SPA that were to be incorporated into the
                    Escrow Agreement. The incorporation issue was a non starter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: The construction issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Escrow Agreement and SPA are two separate
                    and distinct contracts. Bidvest and Vestey are the only two parties to the SPA
                    whereas the Escrow Agreement is a tripartite contract involving Bidvest, Vestey
                    and D1 as stakeholder. The separate and distinct contractual relationship of a
                    written stakeholder agreement is made clear in <em>Manzanilla
                        Limited v Corton Property and Investments Limited</em> (unreported)
                    13 November 1996; Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 1477
                    of 1996 (“<em>Manzanilla</em>”). In that
                    case, a number of contracts of sale and purchase provided for a sum of money to
                    be held by the appellant solicitors “as stakeholders as security for
                    compliance by the Purchaser with its obligations hereunder.” However, it
                    also appears from Millett LJ’s judgment that there was no separate
                    written stakeholder agreement other than the sales contracts themselves. It is
                    within this context that Millett LJ then set out the legal rights and
                    obligations of a stakeholder as established by the authorities:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Where a stakeholder is involved, there are normally
                            two separate contracts to be considered</em></b>. There is first the
                        bilateral contract between the two principals which contemplates two
                        possible alternative future events and by which the parties agree to pay a
                        sum of money to a stakeholder to abide the happening of one or other of
                        them. In the present case it consisted of a series of written contracts for
                        the sale of land, and the relevant events were the failure of the contracts
                        by the repudiatory breach of one party or the other. The second contract is
                        the tripartite contract which results from the deposit of the money with the
                        stakeholder on terms that he is to keep it until one or other of the
                        relevant events happens and then pay it to one or other of the parties
                        accordingly. <b><em>The stakeholder is a party to the second
                            contract but not the first. His rights and obligations are not normally
                            expressly spelled out. They are implicit in the transaction itself, and
                            must be discovered, not by implying terms, but by analysing the
                            relationship of the parties which arises from the deposit of the
                            money</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As there was no written stakeholder agreement
                    that expressly provided for the rights and obligations of the appellant
                    solicitors as stakeholder, Millett LJ relied on the construction of the
                    underlying sales contracts in deciding whether the determining event for the
                    deposit to be released had occurred:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The identification of the determining event is a
                            matter of the construction of the contract</em></b>. I suppose that it
                        is open to the parties to make the determining event not the happening of an
                        actual event itself but the resolution by the Court or otherwise of any
                        dispute as to whether it has happened. I doubt that this would be wise, but
                        the Law Reports are full of cases about transactions far less wise than
                        this. But there is no trace in the books of any such arrangement, which
                        would put the Court in a very curious position. <b><em>There is
                            nothing in the terms of the sales contracts in the present case to lend
                            support to such a term</em></b>. The event upon which the deposits
                        were to be paid to the Vendors is expressed to be the Purchaser’s
                        refusal or failure to complete. The corresponding event upon which they were
                        to be repaid to the Purchaser is not expressly stated but is readily
                        implied; it was the Vendor’s failure or refusal to complete. There is
                        nothing to postpone the stakeholder’s liability in case of dispute
                        until the resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     
          <em>Manzanilla</em> is
                    distinguishable on the facts. In the present case, Bidvest and Vestey had
                    expressly spelled out D1’s stakeholder obligations in the Escrow
                    Agreement. Mr Kumar, on behalf of D1, pointed out that the express terms of
                    the Escrow Agreement provided that D1’s obligations ought to be construed
                    within the four walls of the Escrow Agreement and not together with the
                    underlying SPA. In support of his contention, Mr Kumar referred me to
                        <em>three</em> different provisions, cls 3, 4 and 14 of
                    the Escrow Agreement. They read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    Contemporaneously with our entry into the

<p class="Judg-1">I agreed with Mr Kumar that the statements in these three
                    different clauses reinforced Mr Kumar’s point that the statements
                    clearly and unambiguously confined D1’s stakeholder obligations to the
                    Escrow Agreement alone. A proper starting point must be for this court to look
                    at the express terms of the Escrow Agreement itself. D1’s role as the
                    solicitor for Vesty is separate and distinct from its role as Escrow Agent, and
                    the knowledge of the SPA that D1 gained as Vestey’s solicitor could not
                    change its obligations under the Escrow Agreement, which was where
                    Mr Lee’s arguments were directed. I will elaborate on this point
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     A related point raised by Mr Kumar is
                    that the parties’ intention clearly came from a plain reading of the
                    Escrow Agreement: the parties had intended for D1 to act as Escrow Agent simply
                    in reliance of the documents it received. EA/5(a) required D1 to act <em>on the face of the documents it received</em> and there was
                    accordingly no obligation on D1 to conduct any due diligence or investigation
                    into the veracity of those documents to ascertain whether the transfer had
                    actually been effected (see EA/5(a) set out in full at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    in respect of the amount of US$4 million,
                                <b><em>as soon as any of the documents described below
                                have been delivered to [D1]</em></b>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Following from Mr Kumar’s
                    arguments, the correct interpretation of EA/5(a)(iii) is that the clause simply
                    requires D1 to release the Escrow Sum once it received a Chinese legal opinion
                    stating that it “confirmed that not less than 80% of the underlying
                    assets of Jin Pan have been transferred by other means”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Although Mr Lee had argued that this
                    court should look at the commercial context of the SPA to interpret the Escrow
                    Agreement, crucially, in the course of argument, Mr Lee’s stated that
                        <em>it was because D1 was involved in the SPA</em> that
                    one should look beyond the Escrow Agreement to the commercial context of the
                    SPA. In the same breath, Mr Lee also accepted that if the appointed
                    stakeholder was an independent person (and not the solicitor of one of the
                    parties) who “only knows what his express mandate tells him”
                        (<em>i.e</em>. the Escrow Agreement), then there would
                    be no need to look to the SPA for the commercial context of the underlying
                    transaction to help interpret the Escrow Agreement. To me, Mr Lee’s
                    comments certainly exposed the fallacy of the arguments canvassed before me in
                    the form of the three issues identified above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As stated, the fact that the Escrow Agent is
                    also the solicitor of one of the parties is completely irrelevant as it made no
                    difference. In reality, Bidvest was seeking to go beyond the express mandate in
                    the Escrow Agreement only because of D1’s knowledge of the SPA gained as
                    Vestey’s solicitor in the SPA. Crucially, the distinction that one must
                    remember is that a stakeholder is a principal rather than agent for both
                    parties. The fact that the stakeholder is the solicitor for one of the parties
                    does not alter the nature of the stakeholder’s obligations in the written
                    stakeholder agreement. In <em>Hastingwood Ltd v Saunders Bearman
                        Anselm (a firm)</em> [1991] Ch 114, one of the parties argued
                    that the stakeholders who were solicitors for the other party ought to have held
                    on to the deposit rather than pay it out when there was a dispute between the
                    parties as to which of them was entitled to receive payment
                    (at 124):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Does it make any difference that the stakeholders in the present case were
                        the solicitors for one of the parties, and indeed were directors of that
                        party? Mr. Jackson submits that it does, and that it is not
                        satisfactory that a solicitor who accepts a deposit as stakeholder should be
                        able to take it upon himself to pay the deposit to his own client when the
                        entitlement of his client to the deposit is disputed by the other party to
                        the agreement. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Edward Nugee QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge went on
                    to say that the court would <em>not</em> impose any
                    additional obligations on the stakeholders on the basis that they were
                    solicitors (at 126):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… However, the obligation accepted by Mr. Saunders was an
                        obligation to act as stakeholder until the later in time of the events
                        specified in clause 2(a); and I agree with Mr. Tecks that <b><em>the fact that a stakeholder is a solicitor does not alter the
                            nature of the stakeholder's obligations</em></b> … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Similarly and as stated, in the present case,
                    the mere fact that D1 was also the solicitor for one of the parties would not
                    change the fact that D1 was a principal rather than agent for both parties. It
                    is not unusual for parties to appoint the solicitor of one side to act as
                    stakeholder and that was what happened here. In fact, Bidvest agreed that D1
                    could continue to act as Vestey’s solicitor despite being appointed
                    stakeholder of the Escrow Funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     For the reasons stated, Bidvest’s claim
                    must fail. I accepted that on a plain reading of the Escrow Agreement, D1 was
                    entitled to act on the face of the documents it received and accordingly D1 had
                    acted within the mandate prescribed in the Escrow Agreement in so relying upon
                    the Chinese legal opinion to release the Escrow Sum to Vestey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For completeness, I return to Bidvest’s
                    interpretation of EA/5(a)(iii), which was that D1 could only release the Escrow
                    Sum upon receipt of a legal opinion that “evidenced a transfer of assets
                    to Bidvest or its nominees and not to just anybody”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. That interpretation did not find
                    favour with me for the reasons discussed below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The law of contractual interpretation was not
                    disputed by the parties. Mr Lee submitted that the contextual approach to
                    contractual interpretation as laid down and elaborated in two recent decisions
                    –
                    <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design
                        &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029,
                        (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”) and
                        <em>Tiger Airways Pte Ltd v Swissport Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 992, “<em>Tiger Airways</em>”) – entitled this court to
                    look at the SPA and the pre-contractual negotiations as relevant evidence for
                    the purpose of interpreting the Escrow Agreement. In essence,
                    Mr Lee’s reliance on the SPA and the pre-contractual negotiations was
                    for the purpose of establishing the commercial context within which EA/5(a)(iii)
                    ought to be interpreted. Bidvest’s case was that the Escrow Agreement was
                    intended as “security for Bidvest” to secure Vestey’s
                    compliance in regularising the transfer of Jin Pan’s assets to Bidvest or
                    its nominee. According to Mr Lee, the Escrow Agreement would lose its
                    purpose as “security for Bidvest” should EA/5(a)(iii) be
                    interpreted without due consideration of the terms and the purpose of the
                    underlying SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     To establish its case, Bidvest needed to do
                    two things: (a) persuade this court that the SPA and the pre-contractual
                    negotiations showed that the Escrow Agreement was intended to operate as
                    security for the benefit of Bidvest to ensure Vestey’s compliance under
                    the SPA and, more importantly, (b) show that <em>D1’s
                        obligation pursuant to the Escrow Agreement was to ensure that Vestey had
                        complied with the SPA and to verify that the documents D1 had received
                        evidenced such compliance</em> before releasing the Escrow Sum to
                    Vestey. This second matter would in effect increase the obligation of the Escrow
                    Agent beyond the language of EA/5(a)(iii).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In my view, there was no basis for admitting
                    the extrinsic evidence as argued for by Mr Lee. First, the three
                    requirements that needed to be satisfied for extrinsic evidence to be admitted
                    – the evidence must be relevant, reasonably available to the contracting
                    parties, and relates to a clear and obvious context (<em>Zurich
                        Insurance</em> at [125] and [128]-[129]) – were not met. As
                    for the authorities cited by Mr Lee (<em>Zurich
                        Insurance</em> and <em>Tiger Airways</em>), the
                    extrinsic evidence sought to be admitted in both cases were held to be
                    inadmissible on the ground that the evidence did not point to a clear and
                    obvious context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As I had already determined at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above, on a plain reading of the Escrow
                    Agreement, D1’s obligations were prescribed in the Escrow Agreement and
                    not in the SPA. To advance its contextual argument, Bidvest must establish that
                    the extrinsic evidence it wants to introduce is relevant, reasonably available
                    to all contracting parties, and points to a clear and obvious context that will
                    lead to a different interpretation of the Escrow Agreement. The context which
                    Mr Lee has to establish on behalf of Bidvest is one that clearly and
                    obviously shows that D1’s obligation pursuant to the Escrow Agreement is
                    to secure Vestey’s compliance of the SPA (see <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above). Within this context, the relevance of the SPA to
                    the interpretation of the Escrow Agreement will become apparent. The question
                    then is, whether the extrinsic evidence supports a finding for such a
                    context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Lee tried to establish this context on
                    the following premises: first, that the commercial purpose of the SPA was for
                    the actual title of Jin Pan to pass from Vestey to Bidvest; second, that it was
                    intended that the Escrow Agent must see that Vestey’s obligations in
                    fulfilment of the commercial purpose of the SPA was achieved before releasing
                    the Escrow Funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Lee argued that the SPA had intended
                    for the <em>actual title of Jin Pan’s assets to pass to
                        Bidvest</em> within the 24 month period after the Completion Date and
                    he referred to SPA/3.2, 3.2A and 7.3 for support. Mr Lee pointed to the
                    words “to [Bidvest] or its nominee” in SPA/7.3(a) and submitted
                    that those words must necessarily be imported into its sub-clause
                    SPA/7.3(a)(iii). The relevant portion of SPA/7.3(a) is set out here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) … a transfer of 80% of its underlying assets on terms
                        reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto acting reasonably, or a transfer
                        of 80% equity interest in a new entity that has acquired the underlying
                        assets of Jin Pan (<em>Newco</em>) <b><em>to [Bidvest] or its nominee</em></b>, on terms reasonably acceptable
                        to the parties hereto acting reasonably, has been obtained. [Vestey] shall
                        be deemed to have fulfilled this obligation if any of the following
                        documents has been obtained. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In effect, Mr Lee was submitting that because of the words in
                    SPA/7.3(a), it would follow that SPA/7.3(a)(iii), being a sub-clause of
                    SPA/7.3(a), ought to be read to include the words in italics:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii) a legal opinion from PRC counsel confirming that not less than 80%
                        of the underlying assets of Jin Pan have been transferred by other means
                            [<b><em>to [Bidvest</em></b><b>]</b><b><em> or its
                            nominee</em></b>];<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It was further argued that because the
                    third-level sub-clauses (<em>i</em>) to (<em>iii</em>) of SPA/7.3(a) were worded identically with (<em>i</em>) to (<em>iii</em>) of EA/5(a),
                    both SPA/7.3(a)(iii) and EA/5(a)(iii) <em>ought to be interpreted
                        in the same way</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Although the third-level sub-clauses
                        (<em>i</em>) to (<em>iii</em>) of
                    SPA/7.3(a) were identical to (<em>i</em>) to (<em>iii</em>) of EA/5(a), the <em>second-level</em> sub-clause (<em>a</em>) of
                    SPA/7.3 and sub-clause (<em>a</em>) of EA/5 were worded
                    very differently (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> and <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). That suggested to me that the two
                    agreements operated in two different contexts. Notably, SPA/7.3(a) went into
                    considerable detail in describing <em>Vestey’s</em>
                    obligations regarding the transfer of Jin Pan’s assets whereas EA/5(a)
                    simply provided that <em>D1’s</em> obligation was to
                    release the sum of US$4m as soon as any of the documents described below have
                    been delivered to it. A plain reading of EA/5(a) would be consistent with the
                    parties’ intention for D1 to determine the trigger event and to thereafter
                    discharge its obligation as Escrow Agent with ease, certainty and speed upon the
                    receipt of the specified documents. Ironically, to interpret EA/5(a)(iii) and
                    SPA/7(a)(iii) identically as Bidvest had suggested would be tantamount to
                    ignoring the verbal context directly surrounding those two
                sub-clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I pause here to note that the remaining
                    evidence that was adduced by Bidvest was merely used to establish that the
                    commercial purpose of the SPA was for the transfer of Jin Pan’s assets to
                    Bidvest or its nominee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     For example, Mr Lee submitted that
                    SPA/3.2A and 7.3 provided for an “unwinding mechanism” in the
                    event that the transfers could not be effected and that feature underscored the
                    fact that it was an actual transfer of the assets to Bidvest that was
                    contemplated by the parties:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In my view, Bidvest fell short of establishing
                    a clear and obvious context showing that <em>D1’s
                        obligation</em> as Escrow Agent was to secure Vestey’s
                    compliance under the SPA. At any rate, the construction point was a facile
                    argument that conflated the separate role of the Escrow Agent as a principal in
                    a tripartite contract, and D1’s role as Vestey’s solicitor in the
                    SPA which was a bilateral contract between Bidvest and Vestey. If anything, it
                    is for Bidvest to take issue with Vestey on the Chinese legal opinion outside of
                    OS 667.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On the related question of whether the
                    pre-contractual negotiations were admissible as an interpretive aid, Vestey
                    raised the existence of an entire agreement clause in objection to the admission
                    of pre-contract discussions and documents. It seems to me that the existence of
                    an entire agreement clause <em>per se</em> would generally
                    be insufficient to prevent a court from adopting the contextual approach and
                    considering extrinsic evidence, as the scope of the entire agreement clause
                    itself could depend on the context relating to the particular agreement (see
                        <em>Lee Chee Wei v Tan Peow Victor</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR 537 at [41]). That said, there was no need to dwell
                    on the entire agreement clause argument. I was able to reach the conclusion that
                    the pre-contractual negotiations were not relevant and would not point to any
                    such clear and obvious context. In the recent High Court decision of <em>Goh Guan Chong v AspenTech, Inc</em>
                    [2009] 3 SLR(R) 590 (“<em>AspenTech</em>”) Andrew Ang J held that drafts of
                    contracts were admissible if they passed the requirements set out in <em>Zurich Insurance</em>, but he also cautioned that such
                    evidence may not always be helpful (at [58]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… This is not to say that such evidence will invariably be helpful.
                            <em>Where the parties' respective positions are changing
                            with each draft, there may be scant assistance obtainable by referring
                            to the drafts, the paramount principle being to objectively discover the
                            common intention of the parties …</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Adopting Ang J’s observations, Vestey’s affidavit
                    evidence which was unchallenged on the point was that the parties had gone
                    through several drafts that reflected the parties’ changing positions
                    after negotiations and finally their bargained position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The drafts quite clearly
                    failed to satisfy the <em>Zurich Insurance</em>
                    requirements– the changing drafts and pre negotiations were not relevant
                    to the Escrow Agreement nor did not they point to a clear and obvious
                    context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Similarly, the internal communications between
                    Bidvest’s lawyers and Bidvest’s PRC lawyers were irrelevant to the
                    present case in so far as they represented subjective declarations of intent
                    that were not made available to the other contracting parties. However,
                    Ang J explained in <em>AspenTech</em> that evidence of
                    subjective declarations of intent may, in some cases, carry some weight
                    (at [72]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This, however, does not mean that extrinsic evidence that was only
                        available to one party is necessarily valueless. While such extrinsic
                        evidence rightly cannot be used to conclusively reveal what the contracting
                        parties' objective intention was, it may be used against the maker of
                        statements therein to show the subjective intention of such party. In so
                        doing, such evidence may reveal what the objective intention of the parties
                        could not be. This will occur where the extrinsic evidence available to one
                        party contradicts what that same party asserts was the objective intention
                        of both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     With this, I refer to an internal email dated
                    25 April 2007 that was written by B&amp;M’s Mr Holland to a
                    Ms Tracy Wut:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tracy,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Part of the problem is that <b><em>[D1] as escrow agent want
                            absolute certainty whether an obligation is satisfied, and so want to
                            tie everything back to a piece of paper</em></b>. Is there a piece of
                        paper flowing from the AIC registration that would serve this purpose?
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     From this email, it would appear that
                    Bidvest’s solicitors were actually aware that D1 had intended for its own
                    obligations as Escrow Agent to be tied to specified documents as that would
                    allow it to act with ease, certainty and speed. Such an intention would have
                    corroborated the meaning of EA/5(a) from a plain reading of the provision and
                    was contrary to Bidvest’s professed understanding of the Escrow Agreement
                    as Mr Lee argued for at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Accordingly, I concluded for the reason stated
                    that the extrinsic evidence (the terms of the SPA, the pre-contractual
                    negotiations, and the drafts of the SPA) was inadmissible. As Bidvest had failed
                    to establish any other context for interpreting the Escrow Agreement, I accepted
                    D1’s interpretation of EA/5(a)(iii) as the correct interpretation, which
                    was that EA/5(a)(iii) imposed an obligation on D1 to release the Escrow Sum to
                    Vestey upon receipt of the Chinese legal opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: The implied term issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In submissions, Mr Lee, using the same
                    reasons above, argued that a term ought to be implied into the Escrow Agreement
                    that EA/5(a)(iii) required D1 to receive a legal opinion that evidenced a
                    transfer of assets to Bidvest or its nominees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Going by Mr Lee’s arguments,
                    Bidvest was arguing for a term to be implied in <em>fact</em>, as opposed to a term implied by <em>law</em>. Since an examination of the particular factual matrix
                    concerned is required in order to ascertain whether or not a term ought to be
                    implied in fact (see <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v
                        Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 at [41]), and
                    seeing that Mr Lee was relying on the exact same grounds of argument as the
                    construction issue, it was clearly inapt and unnecessary to imply any additional
                    term into the Escrow Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     For the reasons stated, I dismissed
                    Bidvest’s claim against D1. I ordered D1’s costs of and incidental
                    to OS 667 to be taxed on an indemnity basis and to be paid jointly and severally
                    by Bidvest and Vestey in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. I further ordered
                    Bidvest to pay Vestey’s costs fixed at $5,000.</p>
